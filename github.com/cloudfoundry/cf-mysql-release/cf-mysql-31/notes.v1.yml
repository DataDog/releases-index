[[#131763097](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/131763097)]\n  \n  Allows the operator to configure the execution of a collocated job when the interruptor is triggered\n- switchboard should only log useful statements at INFO [[#131504989](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/131504989)]\n\n### Community Involvement\n- cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release #104: Add openstack stub [[#118640631](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/118640631)]\n  - Merged a PR that adds an IaaS override stub for openstack\n- cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release #127: Specify the cf-mysql-broker ip via manifest [[#130726653](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/130726653)]\n- The `./update` script should work when checked out to a tag [[#130536105](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/130536105)]\n  \n  **Note** The update script now lives in `./scripts/update` to be consistent with other cloudfoundry releases\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- `galera-healthcheck` should respect property to control which user is used to access MySQL [[#128922163](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/128922163)]\n  \n  Previously, the `galera-healthcheck` process would ignore the manifest property and connect as `root`\n- plan sizes in manifest stubs for bosh-lite are confusing [[#129698189](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/129698189)]\n  \n  The manifest stubs now accurately reflect the actual size of the default plans in bosh-lite\n- cf_mysql.mysql.galera_healthcheck.db_password does not exist in standalone example stub file [[#131179845](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/131179845)]\n\n### Manifest Changes\n- Add optional `cf_mysql.mysql.interrupt_notify_cmd`\n  - specifies a path to a file to run when the interruptor triggers\n- Add `cf_mysql.broker.db_password`\n  - the password for the service broker to connect to the database with\n- Add optional property `cf_mysql.broker.host`\n  - ip to be registered with the cf router for the broker; defaults to VM ip\n\n### Exploration\n\nWe have also taken time to find ways to improve the performance and our understanding\nof different components in the cluster\n- Explore ways to make the quota enforcer query less prone to blocking the service broker in a cluster with many tables [[#131471503](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/131471503)]\n  - The quota enforcer runs a query that locks the `mysql.db` table when finding\n    violators and reformers. This story investigated why it does this and how we can\n    improve it.\n"
