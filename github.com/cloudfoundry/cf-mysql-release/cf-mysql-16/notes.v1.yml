This enables us to replace HAProxy with another proxy software package in the future, without additional manual steps or impact to service. \n\nThis change requires operators to follow these manual steps before deploying v16. \n1. Confirm what version of the release is currently deployed\n   \n   ```\n   $ bosh deployments\n   ```\n2. Confirm that there is a job called haproxy associated with this deployment\n   \n   ```\n   $ bosh vms\n   ```\n3. Download the current manifest\n   \n   ```\n   $ bosh download manifest \u003cdeployment-name\u003e /tmp/cf-mysql.yml\n   ```\n4. Rename the haproxy job to proxy in the manifest. On OSX, this can be accomplished with:\n   \n   ```\n   $ sed -i '' 's/name: haproxy/name: proxy/' /tmp/cf-mysql.yml\n   ```\n5. Set the deployment manifest\n   \n   ```\n   $ bosh deployment /tmp/cf-mysql.yml\n   ```\n6. Deploy the renamed job\n   \n   ```\n   $ bosh rename job haproxy proxy\n   ```\n7. Confirm that the job has been renamed correctly\n   \n   ```\n   $ bosh vms\n   ```\n8. Now follow normal steps to generate a new manifest for v16 and deploy\n"
