[[#106994020](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/106994020)]\n  - This [mini-epic](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/epic/show/2160092) automates the process of bootstrapping the MariaDB/Galera cluster via a `bosh errand`. Bootstrapping is only necessary when the MariaDB VMs have been interrupted, either by reboot or network interruption. See the [documentation](docs/bootstrapping.md) for more information.\n- Updated MariaDB to version 10.0.22 [[#106993116](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/106993116)]\n- As an Operator, I'd like to optimize connection performance by skipping reverse DNS resolution [[#106063730](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/106063730)]\n  - We've introduced a new configurable property, `skip_name_resolve` for the mysql jobs. The current default is 'false,' the same behavior of previous versions of cf-mysql-release. When set to 'true,' this option improves performance by skipping DNS resolution to enforce hostname restrictions. In the typical Cloud Foundry context, hostname restrictions are not used.\n    - **Note:** The next release of cf-mysql-release will change the default to 'true'.\n- As an Operator, I'd like to be able to declare service plans as private in the deployment manifest [[#103699052](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/103699052)]\n  - Add support for private plans. In previous versions, all plans were automatically published to all CF organizations by the `broker-registrar` errand. This feature introduces a new optional property, `private`. When set to 'true,' plans will not be published to all CF orgs when running `broker-registrar`. Private plans must be manually published by a cf admin, as described in [the documentation](docs/service-plans-instances.md).\n\n## New Documentation\n- As a BOSH Operator, I should discover that deployment fails if plan names do not conform to CLI format [[#107603894](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/107603894)]\n- As an Application Developer, I'd like to see a link to the documentation when I run `cf service [instance name]` [[#107963372](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/107963372)]\n- Replace manual bootstrap instructions in OSS docs with run errand instructions [[#109827548](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/109827548)]\n\n## Bugfixes and Interestings\n- Quota enforcer will spawn a new process when restarted without killing the existing process [[#99640614](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/99640614)]\n  - Addresses a bug in which the Service Broker VMs may be overloaded by hordes of Quota Enforcer processes.\n- A wildcard SSL cert does not cover proxy-0.p-mysql.domain.com [[#95581184](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/95581184)]\n  - We've changed the proxy dashboard URL from \"proxy-0.p-mysql.DOMAIN\" to \"proxy-0-p-mysql.DOMAIN.\" This subtle change makes the endpoint easier to cover with an SSL wildcard certificate.\n- Service broker should update max user connections on startup [[#109492744](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/109492744)]\n  - Fix bug where max_user_connections quota for existing service instances was not updated when a plan definition is updated.\n- Service broker does not update existing service instances when the size of a plan is updated [[#105336102](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/105336102)]\n  - Fix bug where storage quota for existing service instances was not updated when a plan definition has been changed.\n- broker-registrar errand should update broker if it already exists [[#95587238](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/95587238)]\n  - The `cf update-service-broker` command is now run automatically as part of `broker-registrar` errand. This saves the operator from having to run CF commands manually after adding/modifying plans.\n- Switchboard should not start if proxy or api section fail to run [[#87746750](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/87746750)]\n- Update script should fail fast if permissions denied [[#105491860](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/105491860)]\n- Move concourse config into cf-mysql-ci repo [[#105428042](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/105428042)]\n  - We've separated out our [Continuous Integration assets](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-mysql-ci) into a separate repository for easy access. Try [Concourse](http://concourse.ci/) today!\n\n## Manifest Changes\n- Manifest changes required for bootstrap security [[#106993928](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/106993928)]\n  - Added new properties `bootstrap_endpoint.username` and `bootstrap_endpoint.password`.\n  - To enable the auto-bootstrap feature, you'll find a new section in the Infrastructure stubs provided with the release. You'll need to provide a new username and password for the bootstrap endpoints.\n\n```\n  bootstrap_endpoint:\n      username: REPLACE_WITH_A_USERNAME_YOU_MAKE_UP\n      password: REPLACE_WITH_A_PASSWORD_YOU_MAKE_UP\n```\n- Manifest changes required to declare plans private [[#103699052](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/103699052)]\n  - Service plans are typically defined in `plans_stub.yml`. We've added a new property, `private`. To configure, please read the [documentation](docs/service-plans-instances.md) on service plans.\n- After updating your stubs, make sure to generate a new manifest as described in [Create Manifest and Deploy](/README.md#create-manifest-and-deploy).\n"
