  "Content": "### Cluster Stability Improvements\n\nThis release addresses a limitation in the quota enforcer in which it can interfere in service broker activities.\nThe quota enforcer runs a query is costly relative to the number of tables in the database.\n\nWe've added a property that allows the operator to disable the quota enforcer.\n- Configure my deployment to run without a quota enforcer. [[#131445093](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/131445093)]\n  **Note** If setting `cf_mysql.broker.disable_quota_enforcer: true` in a rolling deploy, service instances that the quota enforcer revoked `INSERT` privileges from will be stuck in this state. This can be solved by manually granting the user full permission to their service instances again with: `GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, CREATE ON \u003cDB_NAME\u003e.* TO '\u003cUSERNAME\u003e'@'%';`. The USERNAME can be found in the service-binding via `cf env`.\n- The super user username is configurable again [[#130544249](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/130544249)]\n\n### Manifest Changes\n- Re-introduce the `cf_mysql.mysql.admin_username`\n  - defaults to `root`\n- Create non-required `cf_mysql.mysql.previous_admin_username`\n  - If changing the `admin_username` property, set this property to the previous value of the `admin_username`. Otherwise, there will be two admins for the cluster.\n"
