  "Content": "# New Features and Configuration Changes\n- cf-mysql-release now includes MariaDB 10.0.19 #[94191012](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/94191012)\n- Specify MySQL plans in a spiff stub so that they can be customized without editing/saving/restoring my entire Bosh manifest #[95585028](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/95585028)\n- Configuration to avoid simultaneous large queries from failing due to a full /tmp #[94691776](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/94691776)\n- Expose Galera configuration options in the manifest so that large database transactions can complete without error #[98155338](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/98155338)\n- Galera healthcheck now returns all Galera states so that the Operator can better reason about the state of the system #[93641798](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/93641798)\n- Enable a configuration to enable the cluster to recover from power failure #[90573188](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/90573188)\n- Security: Require that traffic to the switchboard dashboard be encrypted #[95181616](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/95181616)\n- Security: Run MySQL deployment as user vcap, not root #[95011868](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/95011868)\n\n## New Documentation\n- [Scaling options](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release/blob/v22/docs/cluster-behavior.md#scaling-the-cluster) of the MySQL service components #[95275330](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/95275330)\n- How the service broker and quota enforcer treat [oversubscription](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release/blob/v22/docs/service-broker.md#service-instance-capacity-allocation) #[94248700](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/94248700)\n- Explain how configuring [zero proxies](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release/blob/v22/README.md#proxy) with deployments of cf-mysql-release means that all apps will need to be re-bound in the case of a state change #[92844780](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/92844780)\n\n## Bugfixes and Interestings\n- v20 missing documentation: services1 network #[97153152](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/97153152)\u003cbr\u003e\n  Note: We've renamed the `services1` network to `compilation`\n- MySQL broker dashboard should not return 500 if OAuth access token expires #[96009586](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/96009586)\n\n### Special Note for Amazon AWS users\n\nWe weren't satisfied with the difficulty required to configure cf-mysql-release across multiple AWS AZ's, so we've put some effort into making the stub much easier to follow. For v22, please feel free to use this _pre-release_ version of the stub that will appear in v23. It's been tested and validated to work with v22: http://bit.ly/v23-sample-aws-stub\n- The AWS sample stub follows the convention of using REPLACE for every place a stub should be modified #[99473360](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/99473360)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n## New Documentation for Community Developers\n- Project CONTRIBUTING.md now explains develop / master / release-candidate #[95250996](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/95250996)\n"
