  "Content": "In this release, we introduce support for [bosh linked](https://bosh.io/docs/links.html) `database` and `router` configuration to UAA 3.15.0.\r\n\r\nThe uaa job can now consumes a bosh linked `database` resource as an alternative to the manifest property `uaadb.address`. This is a backwards-compatible change. If your deployment manifest includes the `uaadb.address` property it will take precedence over any bosh links that may be available.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a bosh linked `router` resource can be used in place of `uaa.proxy.servers`. Values specified in the manifest for `uaa.proxy.servers` will continue to take precedence over a bosh link router resource."
