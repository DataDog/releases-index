  "Content": "This release includes [UAA 3.9.2](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/releases/tag/3.9.2)\n\n### IMPORTANT BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES\n\nStarting with this release UAA no longer provides default values for the SAML Service Provider Certificate and JWT Signing Key as a security best practice. These need to be generated explicitly per deployment of UAA and are required for proper start-up and functioning of UAA.\n\nThese are standard artifacts which can be generated using openssl. Please refer the topic [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa-release#generating-a-self-signed-certificate) on how to generate a self signed cert.\n\n```\nlogin.saml.serviceProviderCertificate:\n description: \"UAA SAML Service provider certificate. This is used for signing outgoing SAML Authentication Requests\"\n example: |\n   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n   -----END CERTIFICATE----\n\nlogin.saml.serviceProviderKeyPassword:\n  description: \"Password to protect the service provider private key, blank if no password set.\"\n  example: \"\"\n\nlogin.saml.serviceProviderKey:\ndescription: \"Private key for the service provider certificate.\"\nexample: |\n  -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n  -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n\n login.saml.serviceProviderKeyPassword:\n description: \"Password to protect the service provider private key.\"\n example: \"\"\n\n```\n\n#### Deprecated Format for JWT Signing Key\n\n##### NOTE: Please continue to use this format for setting the signing and verification key in cf-release as it doesn't support reading from the new format yet\n\n```\nuaa.jwt.signing_key:\ndescription: \"Deprecated. Use uaa.jwt.policy.keys. The key used to sign the JWT-based OAuth2 tokens\"\nuaa.jwt.verification_key:\ndescription: \"Deprecated. Use uaa.jwt.policy.keys. The key used to verify JWT-based OAuth2 tokens\"\n```\n\n#### New Format for JWT Signing Keys(verification key needn't be set as we derive it from the Private Key)\n\n```\nuaa.jwt.policy.keys:\n description: \"Map of key IDs and signing keys, each defined with a property `signingKey`\"\n    example:\n      key-1:\n        signingKey: |\n          -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n          -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n\n uaa.jwt.policy.active_key_id:\n description: \"The ID of the JWT signing key to be used when signing tokens.\"\n example: \"key-1\" \n\n```\n"
