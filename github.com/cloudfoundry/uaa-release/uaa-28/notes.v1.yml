  "Content": "There is a very specific upgrade incompatibility going from V24.6 to V28 of UAA Release. This doesn't affect any cf-release upgrades as no cf-release release contains V24.6 version of UAA Release.\r\n\r\nStand-alone UAA-Release customers upgrading v24.6 should use [V29](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa-release/releases/tag/v29) Instead.\r\n"
