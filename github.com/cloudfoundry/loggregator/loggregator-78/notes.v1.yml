  "Content": "**Important Note**\r\nThis version of Loggregator restricts ciphers to use only the following 4 ciphers. This is a breaking change for some operators and a configurable property for opting into more cipher suites was introduced in [Loggregator 85](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/releases/tag/v85)\r\n\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\n\r\n\r\n**New Features**\r\n- When requesting recent logs, a `limit` param can set to return the most `n`  \r\n  most recent log lines  \r\n- Updated [README.md](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/blob/v78/README.md) with useful information about loggregator  \r\n- added instructions for syslog drain binder mutual TLS requirements  \r\n\r\n**Change Log**                                                                                                                                                                                                \r\n- Remove statsd-injector from loggregator and statsd-injector cert generation and moved it  \r\n  to its own release  \r\n- Add deployment, job, and index to Metron metrics\r\n- statsd-injector was removed from the Loggregator repo in this release. It should now be includes as it's own [release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/statsd-injector-release)\r\n\r\n_Note:_ It was discovered that this release introduces an issue where if a metron or doppler dies it's corresponding component exponentially produces logs. A [bug fix](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/140500851) is planned for this issue.\r\n"
