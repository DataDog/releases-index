  "Content": "**Important Note**\r\nThis version of Loggregator restricts ciphers to use only the following 4 ciphers. This is a breaking change for some operators and a configurable property for opting into more cipher suites was introduced in [Loggregator 85](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/releases/tag/v85)\r\n\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\n\r\n\r\n**Changelog:**\r\n-  Fixes bug which results in exponential component log growth when metron/doppler is offline.\r\n- Loggregator components default pprof port to 0 instead of 6060 and 6061. The bound pprof port is emitted in the logs.\r\n"
