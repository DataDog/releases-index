  "Content": "## Important Notice - New Certificates Required for gRPC Transport\r\n\r\nIn order to secure the transport of log messages going forward Loggregator will require Metron cert \u0026 key as well as the Loggregator CA cert. You won't be able to deploy the this and future versions of Loggregator if you don't have these configured. See our [README](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator#generating-tls-certificates) with specifics for generating and setting up your certs.   \r\n\r\n## Important Notice - Cipher Suite Restrictions\r\nThis version of Loggregator restricts ciphers to use only the following 4 ciphers. This is a breaking change for some operators and a configurable property for opting into more cipher suites was introduced in [Loggregator 85](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/releases/tag/v85)\r\n\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\n\r\n## Important Notice - ETCD Removal\r\nThis release removes etcd from metron. You no longer need to include etcd in your release if you are colocating metron. \r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n- Improved service discovery for Dopplers by **removing etcd from metron**\r\n- Encrypted log transport Metron-\u003eDoppler (via gRPC)\r\n- Pooled connections from Metron-\u003eDoppler (via gRPC)\r\n- Changed retry strategy for connecting to with etcd in doppler\r\n"
