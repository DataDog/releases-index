  "Content": "**Important Note**\r\nThis version of Loggregator restricts ciphers to use only the following 4 ciphers. This is a breaking change for some operators and a configurable property for opting into more cipher suites was introduced in [Loggregator 85](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/releases/tag/v85)\r\n\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bug Fixes:**\r\n- Fixed an issue when metron failsover to UDP if provided with invalid certs. TrafficController and Doppler no longer panic if provided with invalid certs.\r\n- Corrected faulty use of `--debug` flag from `metron_agent_windows` job.\r\n- As part of validating certs we erroneously assume certs should have clientAuth value set for extended key usage.\r\n"
