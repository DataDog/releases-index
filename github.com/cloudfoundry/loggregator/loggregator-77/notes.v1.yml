  "Content": "## Important Update to Cert Generation\r\n- Loggregator now requires properties set for mutual auth with Cloud Controller. This is used for retrieving application names for inclusion in syslog drains and is set with the following new properties. \r\n  - `loggregator.tls.syslogdrainbinder.cert`: TLS certificate for syslogdrainbinder, signed by diego bbs CA\r\n  - `loggregator.tls.syslogdrainbinder.key`:  TLS key for syslogdrainbinder, signed by diego bbs CA\r\n  - Use `\u003cdiego-bbs-ca.crt\u003e` and  `\u003cdiego-bbs-ca.key\u003e` when running `generate-loggregator-certs`. The diego BBS CA cert and key are typically generated separately from this script.\r\n  - See the Loggregator [README](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/blob/develop/README.md#generating-tls-certificates) for more details on the new flag\r\n\r\n**Important Note**\r\nThis version of Loggregator restricts ciphers to use only the following 4 ciphers. This is a breaking change for some operators and a configurable property for opting into more cipher suites was introduced in [Loggregator 85](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/releases/tag/v85)\r\n\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\n\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n- \"loggregator\" has been replaced by app, org and space name for host name in syslog drains\r\n"
