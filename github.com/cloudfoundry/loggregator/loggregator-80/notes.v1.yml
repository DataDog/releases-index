  "Content": "**Breaking Changes**\r\n- This release unintentionally introduces an override that breaks a common convention for nozzles. This is fixed in [Loggregator v81](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/releases/tag/untagged-edd464153edb85289d7d)\r\n- This version of Loggregator restricts ciphers to use only the following 4 ciphers. This is a breaking change for some operators and a configurable property for opting into more cipher suites was introduced in [Loggregator 85](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/releases/tag/v85)\r\n\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\n\r\n\r\n**Changelog:**\r\n- Deprecations:\r\n  - Removed statsd-injector.\r\n- Bug fix:\r\n  - Load balancing for metron now randomizes which doppler it connects to.\r\n- Property changes:\r\n  - Traffic Controller now requires the property `loggregator.uaa.client_secret`.
