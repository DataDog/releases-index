  "Content": "## Changes from v1.5.4 to v1.6.0\n- Verified with [garden-runc-release v1.1.1](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-release/releases/tag/v1.1.1).\n- Verified with [garden-windows-bosh-release v0.2.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-windows-bosh-release/releases/tag/v0.2.0).\n- Verified with [etcd-release v90](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/v90).\n- Verified with [cf-mysql-release v32](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release/releases/tag/v32).\n- Verified with [cflinuxfs2-rootfs-release v1.46.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cflinuxfs2-rootfs-release/releases/tag/v1.46.0).\n\n**IMPORTANT**: If you use the [`examples/aws` documentation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/tree/v1.6.0/examples/aws) to deploy a BOSH director and a Diego-backed CF to AWS, please be aware that some of the arguments to the `deploy_aws_environment` script have changed to be more explicit about actions to take on the AWS CloudFormation stack and the BOSH director deployment. The instructions and script also now use the new [v2 BOSH CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-cli) and the [bosh-deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment) repository to deploy the BOSH director. If you have previously deployed your director with `bosh-init`, `bosh create-env` in the new CLI will understand its state file, but you may need to transfer some configuration to new stubs manually. \n\n### Significant changes\n\n#### BBS Relational Datastore\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect the BBS to guard against network failure of its MySQL database connection](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/136754283)\n- [cloudfoundry/bbs #16: Split configuration for open and idle database connections](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/137585203)\n- [cloudfoundry/diego-release #258: Enable setting idle and open connections in bbs](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/137585455)\n\n#### Container Placement\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect to be able to opt the auctioneer into specifying a maximum deployment-wide capacity of allowed in-flight starts](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/137611627)\n\n#### `cfdot`\n- [As a cfdot user, I expect to be able to filter the Task list by domain and/or cell ID](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/129376221)\n- [As a cfdot user, I expect to be able to create a Task](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/129376223)\n\n#### Custom CAs\n- [cloudfoundry/diego-release #259: Bugfix diego.rep.trusted_certs leading two spaces in first certificate](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/137664501)\n\n#### Volume Support\n- [efs, nfs driver connections stay open until all connections are used up](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/137800871)\n\n#### Windows Support\n- [**Add BP support to WAL** - As a developer, I want to push apps and specify an HWC Buildpack, because I'm pushing an HWC app CF-style.](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/138187685)\n\n#### Manifest Generation\n- [As a CF operator, I expect the cf-deployment manifest to secure the auctioneer API](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/136553151)\n\n#### Component Logging and Metrics\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect the BBS benchmarks dashboard timescale to be configurable, defaulting to 1 week](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/137735783)\n\n#### Test Suites and Tooling\n- [As a Diego developer, I expect the benchmark bbs test suite to fail if the results cannot be uploaded to S3](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/136816121)\n- [cloudfoundry/diego-release #246: examples/aws: use v2 BOSH CLI and bosh-deployment](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/136926871)\n\n#### Security\n- [cloudfoundry/diego-release #253: Add require_tls property to rep and rep_windows](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/137486759)\n\n#### Documentation\n- [cloudfoundry/benchmarkbbs #2: Fix convergence property typo](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/137699707)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nNone.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n- Added `diego.bbs.sql.max_idle_connections`: Maximum number of idle connections for the BBS to retain to its relational database.\n- Added `diego.rep.consul.require_tls`: Whether to require mutual TLS for the rep's communication to the local consul agent.\n- Added `diego.rep.consul.ca_cert`: CA certificate for the rep's TLS communication to the local consul agent.\n- Added `diego.rep.consul.client_cert`: Certificate for the rep's TLS communication to the local consul agent.\n- Added `diego.rep.consul.client_key`: Private key for the rep's TLS communication to the local consul agent.\n"
