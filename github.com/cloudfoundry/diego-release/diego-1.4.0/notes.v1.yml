  "Content": "## Changes from v1.3.1 to v1.4.0\n- Verified with [garden-runc-release v1.0.4](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-runc-release/releases/tag/v1.0.4).\n- Verified with [garden-windows-bosh-release v0.1.0](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/garden-windows-bosh-release/releases/tag/v0.1.0).\n- Verified with [etcd-release v87](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/v87).\n- Verified with [cf-mysql-release v32](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release/releases/tag/v32).\n- Verified with [cflinuxfs2-rootfs-release v1.43.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cflinuxfs2-rootfs-release/releases/tag/v1.43.0).\n\n**IMPORTANT**: This version of Diego requires garden-runc v1.0.4 or later, as it makes use of the Garden API's new `PidLimits` feature. This feature in turn requires running Linux Diego cells on kernel 4.4 or later (BOSH stemcell version 3263+).\n\n### Significant changes\n\n#### Container Execution\n- [As a BBS API client, I expect to be able to specify container-wide process limits on Tasks and LRPs](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/135530505)\n\n#### Windows Support\n- [cloudfoundry/diego-ssh #28: Don't try to syscall.exec on Windows](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/135979115)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nNone.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n\nNone.\n"
