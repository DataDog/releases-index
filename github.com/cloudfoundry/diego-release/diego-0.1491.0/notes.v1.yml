The CAPI team has also already effectively ended support for this feature in their work to merge the 'stager' CC-Bridge component into Cloud Controller and to submit all Diego workloads as unprivileged containers. If your Docker-image-based app fails to stage correctly, try unsetting its `DIEGO_DOCKER_CACHE` environment variable. In practice, developers have been interested in the \"caching\" staging process primarily because it allowed them to run Docker images from registries that required authentication, and we hope to have first-class support for that use case soon.\n\n### Significant changes\n\n#### BBS Relational Datastore\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect to have comprehensive documentation about using a Postgres data store for the BBS](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/133428661) (in flight)\n- [SQL encryption db should re-encrypt routes data](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/134143535)\n\n#### Component Coordination\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect the rep always to shut down when destroying residual containers after evacuation times out](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/133061923)\n\n#### SSH\n- [cloudfoundry/diego-ssh #25: Additional Security Logging Requested](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/133843331)\n- [cloudfoundry/diego-ssh #26: Extract username, userid from token and use for additional security logging](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/133848389)\n\n#### Docker Support\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect the docker app lifecycle no longer to support the image-caching staging option](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/133638427)\n\n#### Manifest Generation\n- [Pull consul_agent and metron_agent from cf-release](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/133772873)\n- [cloudfoundry/diego-release #223: Pull windows job from CF instead of garden-windows](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/134273711)\n\n#### Component Logging and Metrics\n- [cloudfoundry/diego-release #224: Add syslog for rep_windows job](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/134275941)\n- [Fix regression in new garden container creation/deletion metrics](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/133707379)\n- [As a Diego operator, I would like to observe each cell to report metrics about how long garden takes to destroy a container or to fail to create a container](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/121910463)\n\n#### Test Suites and Tooling\n- [Potential race condition in fake_clock](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/130238495)\n- [cloudfoundry/clock #1: Fixes a race condition that can happen when timers are used as tickers](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/134396773)\n\n#### Security\n- [As a Diego security auditor, I expect not to observe credentials in the ssh-proxy command line](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/128799799)\n- [As a Diego operator, I would like to ensure that TLS communication to Diego components uses strong ciphers and protocols](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/134554281)\n\n#### Documentation\n- [As a CF operator, I expect the diego-release AWS example instructions to deploy a secure BOSH director](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/134538153)\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect to be able to override the instance types of the Diego VMs in the AWS example instructions](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/134601631)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nNone.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n\nNone.\n"
