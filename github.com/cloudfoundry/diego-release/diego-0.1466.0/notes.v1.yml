Opting into this support via the `diego.bbs.sql.db_connection_string` BOSH property is not yet recommended for existing deployments or for new production deployments, as existing data will not yet be migrated from the etcd datastore and the SQL schema is subject to change. The relational store is also not included in the Diego deployment manifest that the manifest-generation scripts produce.\n\nThis version of diego-release also updates the bundled Golang package to version 1.6.1 to address [CVE-2016-3958](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-3958) and [CVE-2016-3959](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-3959). More details are in the [Golang announement](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/golang-announce/9eqIHqaWvck/discussion).\n\n#### BBS Relational Datastore (Experimental)\n- [As a Diego developer, I can run BBS unit tests against MySQL on my local workstation](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113854821)\n- [As a Diego operator, I can run a CF+Diego deployment backed by a MySQL DB instance](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113854827) (in flight)\n\n#### Component Logging and Metrics\n- [As a Diego operator, I would like to see a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the BBS logs](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114637909)\n\n#### Dependencies\n- [Update Golang in diego-release to 1.6.1+](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/117508923)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nNone.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n- Add `diego.bbs.sql.db_connection_string`: Connection string to use for SQL backend.\n"
