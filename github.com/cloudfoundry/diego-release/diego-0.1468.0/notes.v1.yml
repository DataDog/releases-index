We strongly recommend that all operators on Diego v0.1468.0 through v0.1470.0 upgrade to [Diego v0.1471.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release/releases/tag/v0.1471.0) or later. [Diego v0.1472.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release/releases/tag/v0.1472.0) is recommended for use with the recently released [CF v237](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v237) and should be compatible with [CF v236](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v236).\n\n#### BBS Relational Datastore (Experimental)\n- [As a Diego developer, I expect BBS unit tests to run against both MySQL and etcd in CI](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113854823) (in flight)\n- [As a Diego developer, I expect inigo and component integration test suites to run against both MySQL and etcd in CI](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113854825) (in flight)\n\n#### Performance Tuning\n- [Investigate ketchup multiple bbs locks](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/117967437)\n\n#### Container Execution\n- [ClaimActualLRP should set the Since field on the ActualLRP and should be a no-op if nothing important changes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/110477586)\n\n#### Volume Support (Experimental)\n- [cephfs driver can be colocated on the Cell](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112362783)\n- [Volume Drivers are discoverable](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115269143)\n- [remove spec file writing from the certification suite (and add to fakedriver for tcp).](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/117104435)\n- [fakedriver certified with json spec](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/117108133)\n\n#### App Logging\n- [Executor log streamer does not handle all UTF-8 boundary cases correctly](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/111867019)\n\n#### Component Logging and Metrics\n- [Change BBS `Client` to `InternalClient` and `ExternalClient` to `Client`, and add logging to the methods](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/110940106) (in flight)\n- [As a Diego operator, I would like to see a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the BBS logs](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114637909)\n- [Do not log ssh routes private key in bbs logs.](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/117742657)\n\n#### Documentation\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release #159: Update fingerprint generation command](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/117855121)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nNone.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n- Added `benchmark-bbs.ginkgo_nodes`: Number of Ginkgo nodes to run in BBS benchmark test suite.
