This feature requires a BOSH director at version 1.3213.0 or later, available in [BOSH-release v255.4](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh/releases/tag/stable-3213).\n\n#### BBS Relational Datastore (Experimental)\n- [As a Diego operator, I should be able to follow documentation to deploy an HA standalone CF-MySQL cluster on my infrastructure](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/117843835)\n- [As a Diego operator, I should be able to use Postgres as a backing relational store for the Diego BBS](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/119290575) (in flight)\n- [As a Diego operator, I would like the examples/aws boosh-strapping to include subnets for MySQL in each AZ so that I do not have to create them manually](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/120799137)\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect the BBS to recover from catastrophic data loss in the relational store so that the system remains functional](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/121411037) (in flight)\n- [As a Diego operator, I would like the option to use the Postgres instance in the CF deployment as a relational backend for the BBS so that I do not have to deploy a separate deployment](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/121419131) (in flight)\n\n#### Performance Tuning\n- [The rep BOSH job should give the rep enough time to perform its garden healthcheck when starting up](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112528773)\n\n#### Garden-RunC Integration\n- [As a Diego operator, I can follow documentation to understand that when changing an existing Diego deployment to use garden-runc instead of garden-linux, I need to recreate the cell VMs so that I do not have a deployment failure](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/119842761)\n\n#### Component Logging and Metrics\n- [Cells should emit their UnhealthyCell metric every 30s](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/110230874)\n\n#### Security\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect all of the processes invoked by diego-release ctl scripts to be run as an unprivileged user so that I am better insulated from security vulnerabilities](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/119191585)\n\n#### Documentation\n- [The `ResolvingTask` and `DeleteTask` methods should be included in the `ExternalTaskClient` BBS interface](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115575449) (in flight)\n- [Document the public LRP API and related types on the BBS](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115611661) (in flight)\n- [Document additional Volume types and fields added with Persi work](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116754967) (in flight)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nAdded post-start script for `rep` job template.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n- Add `diego.bbs.sql.db_driver`: Driver for BBS to use against a SQL store.\n"
