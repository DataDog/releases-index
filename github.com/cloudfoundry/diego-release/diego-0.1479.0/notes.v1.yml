  "Content": "## Changes from v0.1478.0 to v0.1479.0\n- Verified with [garden-linux-release v0.339.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux-release/releases/tag/v0.339.0).\n- Verified with [garden-runc-release v0.4.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-runc-release/releases/tag/v0.4.0).\n- Verified with [etcd-release v58](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/v58).\n- Verified with [cflinuxfs2-rootfs-release v1.17.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cflinuxfs2-rootfs-release/releases/tag/v1.17.0).\n\n### Significant changes\n\n**IMPORTANT**: This release corrects a bug in the execution of Docker-image-based CF apps wherein the `HOME` and `TMPDIR` environment variables were always set to `app` and `app/tmp`. With this release, they will instead be set to the values specified in the CF app configuration, in the Docker image itself, or, in the case of `HOME`, the default home directory of the user running the start command, in that order.\n\n#### BBS Benchmarks\n- [As a CF Community member, I would like to see the Diego team's benchmark BBS results](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/109822510)\n- [BBS benchmarks should organize report files in one folder per benchmark run](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113637627)\n\n#### BBS Relational Datastore (Experimental)\n- [Explore Diego BBS performance with a Postgres 9.4.6 backing store to discover any performance issues resulting from hand-rolled upserts](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/121429723)\n\n#### Container Execution\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect garden-linux to be configured to destroy containers on startup so that the rep does not always have to do it itself](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/121156419)\n\n#### Component Coordination\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect components that register themselves as services with consul DNS should continue to register correctly after interruptions in consul server availability](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/118957335)\n\n#### Routing\n- [As an app developer, I expect that the system should unregister HTTP routes for instances that are no longer desired](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/118496003) (in flight)\n\n#### Volume Support (Experimental)\n- [Add metrics and logging to volman](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/121514319)\n- [extract voldriver into it's own repo](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/122239837)\n- [minimal test coverage for cmd/volman](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/122240205)\n\n#### Docker Support\n- [As a CF user, I expect Docker-image-based apps to have their HOME and TMPDIR env vars set either from the image environment or from the app environment so that they operate correctly](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/122608871) (in flight)\n\n#### Manifest Generation\n- [Diego manifest generation should support changing the privileged containers property](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/124972511)\n\n#### App Logging and Metrics\n- [As a CF app operator, I would like to see more frequent updates of metrics for my app instances](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/101652884) (in flight)\n- [As an developer, I expect to see log lines from the cell when my app containers are destroyed so that I can better understand the lifespan of my instances](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/123264641)\n\n#### Component Logging and Metrics\n- [As a Diego operator, I would like each final version of diego-release to have a complete list of metrics emitted by the Diego components with types and descriptions](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112544565) (in flight)\n\n#### Dependencies\n- [Fix the issues with Git v2.9 and buildpack_app_lifecycle/buildpackrunner](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/122698721)\n\n#### Test Suites and Tooling\n- [As a Diego developer, I expect the vizzini errand script to write its stdout and stderr out to files in /var/vcap/sys/log](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113897717)\n- [Fix failing tests in docker_app_lifecycle/builder](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/122699661)\n- [Fix data race in dockerapplifecycle tests](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/123648001)\n\n#### Security\n- [Explore diego-release deployment and ctl scripts with credentials with special characters to discover failures to encode credentials correctly](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/111846405)\n\n#### Documentation\n- [As a Diego operator, I would like the diego-release documentation to include instructions for deploying Diego to a minimal AWS environment](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/100909610)\n- [Document the public Cells API on the BBS](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115615997)\n- [Document the Diego container runtime environment](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115625391)\n\n#### De-Incubation\n- [As a CF contributor, I expect to find the Diego-owned CF Golang repositories in the cloudfoundry GitHub organization, imported and referred to via the code.cloudfoundry.org domain](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/121932033)\n- [As a CF contributor, I expect to find the Diego-owned pivotal-golang repositories migrated into the cloudfoundry GitHub organization, imported and referred to via the code.cloudfoundry.org domain](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/121962459)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nNone.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n- Add `diego.executor.container_metrics_report_interval`: Interval on which the cell rep should report container metrics.\n"
