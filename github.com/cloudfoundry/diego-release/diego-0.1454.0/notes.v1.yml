  "Content": "## Changes from v0.1453.0 to v0.1454.0\n- Depends on [garden-linux-release v0.333.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux-release/releases/tag/v0.333.0).\n- Depends on [etcd-release v36](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/v36).\n\n### Significant changes\n\nOperators can now install a set of trusted system certificates in the default `/etc/ssl/certs` trust store of the cflinuxfs2 rootfs. This is particularly useful if your cflinuxfs2-based instances communicate with external services signed by a custom CA, in which case you can use this feature to install that CA certificate in all the instances.\n\nTo install the certificates, supply the contents of the PEM-encoded certificates in the `diego.rootfs_cflinuxfs2.trusted_certs` property in the Diego deployment manifest. As with other PEM-encoded manifest data, you may wish to use the YAML `|` block-literal syntax to specify the property, as follows:\n\n``` yaml\nproperties:\n  diego:\n    rootfs_cflinuxfs2:\n      trusted_certs: |\n        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n        (cert number 1 data)\n        -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n        # comments outside the PEM boundaries will be ignored\n        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n        (cert number 2 data)\n        -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n```\n\nIf you are using the spiff-based manifest-generation scripts, this property can also be specified in the property-overrides stub.\n\n#### Custom CAs\n- [As a CF user, I expect all Tasks and LRPs using the cflinuxfs2 rootfs to contain trusted certificates in their default trust store](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112556023)\n- [As a CF user, I expect trusted certificates to be available to cflinuxfs2- and Docker-image app instances in a conventional location](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113241421) (in flight)\n\n#### SSH\n- [investigate whether we can use CF_INSTANCE_PORTS instead of rewriting diego-sshd port arguments](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/110778272)\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-ssh #17: Rewrite listen address using CF_INSTANCE_PORTS on Windows](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113653151)\n\n#### Routing\n- [The route-emitter should log and emit metrics if it detects two distinct instances with the same address in its in-memory routing table](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112193855)\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/nsync #6: Dont populate cf-routes if CC does not send routes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113509449)\n- [developer should be able to verify that when deleting an app or route, it's route_mappings are also deleted](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112640495) (in flight)\n\n#### Manifest Generation\n- [As a CF+Diego operator, I would like to use the Diego team's tooling to deploy CF and Diego to an AWS environment](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112126901)\n- [As a Diego operator, I would like a script to generate a vizzini errand manifest for my Diego deployment](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112343977)\n\n#### Dependencies\n- [Upgrade cflinuxfs2 rootfs in diego-release to ~~1.35.0+~~ 1.36.0+](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113869987)\n\n#### Test Suites and Tooling\n- [The dusts should work against the latest bosh-lite box.](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113579727)\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release #135: 132 - Verify this repos isn't a submodule before invoking install-git-hooks](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113586867)\n\n#### Documentation\n- [Document the Tasks API (public and internal) and Actions on the BBS](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112320939) (in flight)\n\n#### Cleanup\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/cf_http #2: Common response generation methods were present throughout Diego.](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112553127)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nNone.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n- Added `diego.rootfs_cflinuxfs2.trusted_certs`: Bundle of certificates to install in the cflinuxfs2 rootfs default trust store (`/etc/ssl/certs`).\n"
