  "Content": "## Changes from v1.16.1 to v1.17.0\r\n\r\n- Verified with [garden-runc-release v1.7.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-release/releases/tag/v1.7.0).\r\n- Verified with [garden-windows-bosh-release v0.4.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-windows-bosh-release/releases/tag/v0.4.0).\r\n- Verified with [etcd-release v109](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/v109).\r\n- Verified with [cf-mysql-release v35](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release/releases/tag/v35).\r\n- Verified with [cflinuxfs2-release v1.123.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cflinuxfs2-release/releases/tag/v1.123.0).\r\n\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT**: This version of diego-release introduces two significant changes to the manifest-generation system that may affect operators:\r\n\r\n- As warned in the [release notes for Diego v1.14.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v1.14.0), the manifest-generation templates now support only the cflinuxfs2 release, and the `-r` flag has no effect.\r\n\r\n- The manifest-generation script now requires that the `-s` flag be specified, with its argument a path to the SQL configuration stub file for the BBS component (and optionally locket). The BBS has required SQL configuration since [Diego v1.2.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v1.2.0), so operators will already be specifying this flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Significant changes\r\n\r\n#### Container Placement\r\n\r\n- [As a CF operator, I expect the BBS to remove extra Claimed and Running ActualLRPs owned by a missing cell](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/146054449)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Manifest Generation\r\n\r\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect the manifest-generation script to require a SQL stub argument](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/135746641)\r\n- [Clear out obsolete loggregator tcp+tls configuration in Diego manifest generation templates](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/141334213)\r\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect the manifest-generation script to support only the cflinuxfs2 release](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143937345)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Dependencies\r\n\r\n- [As a CF operator, I expect diego-release to use Golang 1.8.2+ such that the auctioneer supports connecting to large Diego cell deployments](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/145913949)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Test Suites and Tooling\r\n\r\n- [Finish running complete set of Diego unit tests on Windows](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143825745)\r\n- [Investigate units-mysql failures in CI](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/145888607)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Cleanup\r\n\r\n- [Remove upsert from bbs/sqlhelpers.](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/144755851)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BOSH job changes\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BOSH property changes\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BOSH link changes\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n"
