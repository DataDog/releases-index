We strongly recommend that all operators on Diego v0.1468.0 through v0.1470.0 upgrade to [Diego v0.1471.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release/releases/tag/v0.1471.0) or later. [Diego v0.1472.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release/releases/tag/v0.1472.0) is recommended for use with the recently released [CF v237](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v237) and should be compatible with [CF v236](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v236).\n\n#### BBS Relational Datastore (Experimental)\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect the BBS to migrate existing data from etcd to the relational store](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/117843829) (in flight)\n- [As a Diego operator, I should be able to follow documentation to deploy an single-node standalone CF-MySQL cluster on my infrastructure](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/117843833)\n- [As a Diego operator, I should be able to follow documentation to provision an RDS MySQL instance to support my AWS Diego deployment](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/117843837)\n- [As a Diego client, I would like the Diego system to be resilient to deadlock errors from its MySQL backend](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/118508463)\n\n#### Volume Support (Experimental)\n- [Volume Driver requests are retried with backoff before failing](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115270017)\n- [Volman can discover docker drivers in an ordered list of folders](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/118324851)\n- [Make sure Volman uses the communication semantics as docker when talking to drivers](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/118526797)\n\n#### Garden-RunC Integration\n- [LRP instance containers should have only the instance guid as the container handle](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/118462753)\n\n#### CC-Bridge Transfer\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect Diego manifest generation to namespace bridge components under capi](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/118520483)\n\n#### App Logging\n- [TPS watcher fails to generate crash events for intermittently crashing apps](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116637751) (in flight)\n\n#### Component Logging and Metrics\n- [Change BBS `Client` to `InternalClient` and `ExternalClient` to `Client`, and add logging to the methods](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/110940106)\n\n#### Documentation\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release #160: deploy_aws_environment script assumes 'bosh' keypair name](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/118147277)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nNone.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n\nNone.\n"
