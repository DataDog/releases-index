This regression will be fixed in the next final version of Diego, to be released as soon as possible. In the meantime, operators can work around this by ensuring the following properties are populated in the CF manifest that is supplied in the `-c` flag on the Diego manifest-generation script:\n\n``` yaml\nproperties:\n  database:\n    address: REPLACE_WITH_ARBITRARY_VALUE_IF_ABSENT\n    port: REPLACE_WITH_ARBITRARY_VALUE_IF_ABSENT\n    roles:\n    - name: diego\n      password: REPLACE_WITH_ARBITRARY_VALUE_IF_ABSENT\n```\n\nIf you add these missing values, you may then remove them from the CF manifest before re-deploying CF.\n\n### Significant changes\n\n#### Component Coordination\n- [cloudfoundry/auctioneer #4: Bump consul TTL timeout to 20s](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/135697743)\n- [cloudfoundry/bbs #14: Bump consul TTL timeout to 20s](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/135698023)\n- [cloudfoundry/diego-ssh #27: Bump consul TTL timeout to 20s](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/135698149)\n- [cloudfoundry/fileserver #5: Bump consul TTL timeout to 20s](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/135698215)\n\n#### `cfdot`\n- [As a cfdot user, I expect to be able to list all the Tasks in the BBS](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/129376219)\n\n#### Local Route Emitters (Experimental)\n- [In local route-emitter mode, the registered endpoints for an evacuating LRP instance should switch over with minimal overlap](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/136153749)\n\n#### Volume Support\n- [add warning to volman when cell mount path is not /var/vcap/data...](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/134284237)\n\n#### Windows Support\n- [Add firewall rule for Rep.listen_addr_securable](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/137093839)\n- [cloudfoundry/diego-release #249: Add windows firewall rule for listen_addr_securable](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/137101791)\n- [cloudfoundry/diego-release #251: Run rep.exe directly, no powershell start script](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/137145757)\n\n#### Manifest Generation\n- [cloudfoundry/diego-release #237: Import DB properties from CF config](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/136042111)\n- [Handle new `uaa.ca_cert` property in `example/aws`](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/137549843)\n\n#### Licensing\n- [Tidy up license/notify files](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/135974117)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nNone.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n\nNone.\n"
