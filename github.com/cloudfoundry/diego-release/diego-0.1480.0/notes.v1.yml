Operators of Diego deployments should now consider which relational data store deployment will be suitable to back their new and existing Diego deployments, as a relational data store will be required configuration when Diego advances to major version 1. Please see [further documentation on Diego data stores](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/blob/master/docs/data-stores.md) for a more complete description of the supported options and of how data will automatically be migrated from etcd to the relational store when both are configured.\n\n#### BBS Relational Datastore\n- [As a Diego operator, I would like the diego-release documentation to explain my options for Diego's data store so that I can be assured of upgrading safely](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/124699331)\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect to find that relational database support is no longer experimental so that I can safely migrate my deployment to it](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/124700141)\n\n#### Container Execution\n- [As a CF developer, I expect the Diego healthcheck to log and to exit with different status codes for different types of failures](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/124683931)\n\n#### SSH\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect that the diego-sshd process command line does not contain credentials so that unauthorized actors on the Cell VM cannot enter the container via SSH](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/120860423) (in flight)\n\n#### Routing\n- [As an app developer, I expect that the system should unregister HTTP routes for instances that are no longer desired](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/118496003) (in flight)\n\n#### Volume Support (Experimental)\n- [test localdriver with docker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/118660173)\n\n#### Manifest Generation\n- [Standardize benchmark-bbs manifest generation](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113411377)\n\n#### App Logging and Metrics\n- [As a CF app operator, I would like to see more frequent updates of metrics for my app instances](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/101652884)\n\n#### Component Logging and Metrics\n- [As a Diego operator, I would like each final version of diego-release to have a complete list of metrics emitted by the Diego components with types and descriptions](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112544565)\n\n#### Documentation\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect to have high-level documentation for deploying Diego alongside an existing CF deployment](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/124300751)\n\n#### De-Incubation\n- [Fix accidental reversion of bytefmt commits in import-path update](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/125178941)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nNone.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n\nNone.\n"
