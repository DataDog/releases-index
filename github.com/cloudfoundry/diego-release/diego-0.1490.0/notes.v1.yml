These properties are intended to replace the monolithic `diego.bbs.sql.db_connection_string` property, which encodes too much driver-specific information. They retain the existing `diego.bbs.sql.db_driver` property, and add sibling `db_host`, `db_port`, `db_schema`, `db_username`, and `db_password` properties. We strongly encourage operators to switch to these new properties as soon as possible. In particular, to avoid ambiguity in the deployment manifest, _using both these new properties and the older connection string property results in a failure to render the BBS job template_ and hence a deployment error.\n\n### Significant changes\n\n#### BBS Relational Datastore\n- [As a Diego operator, I would like a more granular format to supply BBS SQL database connection properties](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/133715603)\n\n#### Routing\n- [Route Emitter loses routes when unfresh domain contains LRPs that match existing routing table entries](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/133064393)\n\n#### Component Logging and Metrics\n- [pivotal-golang/lager #20: Don't panic if message.Data can't be converted to json](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/119449707)\n\n#### Test Suites and Tooling\n- [add tls configuration for rep in inigo](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/133231235)\n- [cloudfoundry/diego-release #219: fix typo](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/134046243)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nNone.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n- Added `diego.bbs.sql.db_host`: Host for BBS SQL data store.\n- Added `diego.bbs.sql.db_port`: Port for BBS SQL data store.\n- Added `diego.bbs.sql.db_schema`: Database name for BBS SQL data store.\n- Added `diego.bbs.sql.db_username`: Username for BBS to access SQL data store.\n- Added `diego.bbs.sql.db_password`: Password for BBS to access SQL data store.\n- Added `benchmark-bbs.sql.db_host`: Host for BBS SQL data store.\n- Added `benchmark-bbs.sql.db_port`: Port for BBS SQL data store.\n- Added `benchmark-bbs.sql.db_schema`: Database name for BBS SQL data store.\n- Added `benchmark-bbs.sql.db_username`: Username for BBS benchmark suite to access SQL data store.\n- Added `benchmark-bbs.sql.db_password`: Password for BBS benchmark suite to access SQL data store.\n- Deprecated `diego.bbs.sql.db_connection_string`.\n- Deprecated `benchmark-bbs.sql.db_connection_string`.\n"
