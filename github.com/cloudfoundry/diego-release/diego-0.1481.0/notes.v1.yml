Instead, the active BBS server runs Task and LRP convergence periodically and in reaction to a cell presence disappearing. \n\n#### BBS Relational Datastore\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect to be able to upgrade my MySQL-backed deployment from the earliest supported version to the latest without downtime](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/119290583)\n\n#### Performance\n- [As a Diego developer, I would like to have tooling to extract performance metrics from BBS and auctioneer logs](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126068677)\n\n#### Component Coordination\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect the active BBS to handle LRP and Task convergence so that I can remove the converger job](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/123284391)\n\n#### SSH\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect that the diego-sshd process command line does not contain credentials so that unauthorized actors on the Cell VM cannot enter the container via SSH](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/120860423)\n- [cloudfoundry/diego-ssh #22: Rename 'appplication' to 'application'](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126538023)\n\n#### Routing\n- [As an app developer, I expect that the system should unregister HTTP routes for instances that are no longer desired](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/118496003)\n- [Investigate Evacuating Instances how we emit the routes in route-emitter.](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126354423)\n\n#### Garden-RunC Integration\n- [Look into inigo-etcd-runc failures](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126250291)\n\n#### Manifest Generation\n- [CF-MySQL manifest from `generate-mysql-bosh-lite-manifest` script does not deploy with latest CF-MySQL release-candidate](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/125013921)\n\n#### App Logging and Metrics\n- [As a CF developer, if bits fail to stream into the container, I expect to see relevant information in the app logs and the crash event so that I can diagnose the failure](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/121305421)\n- [As a CF developer, I expect the Diego healthcheck to log and to exit with different status codes for different types of failures](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/124683931)\n\n#### Dependencies\n- [As an OSS developer, I expect diego-release to document how to install v0.6.4 of consul so that my local dependencies can match those in consul-release](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/121241199)\n\n#### Test Suites and Tooling\n- [Investigate \"container expired\" failures on CI environments](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/125988451)\n- [fix dockerapplifecycle flaky tests](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126157065)\n\n#### Documentation\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect to follow documentation about any deployment-order constraints  so that I can be sure that my deployment is upgraded safely](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/107900590)\n- [Document the internal Tasks API on the BBS](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115616037)\n- [Document the internal LRP API on the BBS](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115616359)\n- [Document the public events API and related types on the BBS](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115632259)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nRemoved `converger` job.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n- Added convergence properties to BBS:\n  - `diego.bbs.convergence.repeat_interval_in_seconds`: Interval between runs of the convergence process.\n  - `diego.bbs.convergence.kick_task_duration_in_seconds`: Interval between kicks to tasks.\n  - `diego.bbs.convergence.expire_completed_task_duration_in_seconds`: Duration after which completed, unresolved tasks are deleted.\n  - `diego.bbs.convergence.expire_pending_task_duration_in_seconds`: Duration after which unclaimed tasks are marked as failed.\n- Removed converger properties:\n  - `diego.converger.debug_addr`\n  - `diego.converger.repeat_interval_in_seconds`\n  - `diego.converger.kick_task_duration_in_seconds`\n  - `diego.converger.expire_completed_task_duration_in_seconds`\n  - `diego.converger.expire_pending_task_duration_in_seconds`\n  - `diego.converger.log_level`\n  - `diego.converger.dropsonde_port`\n  - `diego.converger.bbs.api_location`\n  - `diego.converger.bbs.ca_cert`\n  - `diego.converger.bbs.client_cert`\n  - `diego.converger.bbs.client_key`\n  - `diego.converger.bbs.require_ssl`\n  - `diego.converger.bbs.client_session_cache_size`\n  - `diego.converger.bbs.max_idle_conns_per_host`\n"
