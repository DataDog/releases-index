We have identified a regression in the ability of the auctioneer to fetch the cell states at the start of each auction, such that in a large deployment a significant proportion of the state requests will time out. We do not observe this problematic behavior on Diego v1.15.0. Since the only real change between the versions is the update to use Golang v1.8.1 instead of v1.7.4, we strongly suspect that moving back to Golang v1.7.4 will resolve the issue, and we plan to do that for the next release. We will then investigate and resolve this issue on Golang v1.8.1 before returning to that Golang version in diego-release.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Significant changes\r\n\r\n#### BBS Benchmarks\r\n\r\n- [As a Diego PM, I expect CI to run the BBS benchmarks at scale against a Postgres-backed BBS](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/134111165) (in flight)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Executor Cache\r\n\r\n- [As a CF operator, I expect the rep to reuse droplet tarballs in its cache](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/135010237)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Grootfs Integration\r\n\r\n- [inigo CI jobs should consume grootfs code from latest BOSH release instead of from master of the grootfs repo](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/142968571)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Dependencies\r\n\r\n- [Upgrade golang in diego-release to 1.8.1+](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/138580379)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Test Suites and Tooling\r\n\r\n- [Investigate hanging units-common https://diego.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/main/jobs/units-common/builds/328](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/144497911)\r\n- [Fix unit-windows flaky test](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/144561585)\r\n- [fix nsync-bulker communication with CC on ketchup and other CI environments](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/144562223)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Security\r\n\r\n- [Configure BOSH-Lite cells to serve the rep API over TLS instead of plain HTTP](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/144229819)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Documentation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BOSH job changes\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BOSH property changes\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BOSH link changes\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n"
