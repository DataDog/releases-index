  "Content": "## Changes from v1.17.0 to v1.18.0\r\n\r\n- Verified with [garden-runc-release v1.7.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-release/releases/tag/v1.7.0).\r\n- Verified with [garden-windows-bosh-release v0.4.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-windows-bosh-release/releases/tag/v0.4.0).\r\n- Verified with [etcd-release v111](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/v111).\r\n- Verified with [cf-mysql-release v35](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release/releases/tag/v35).\r\n- Verified with [cflinuxfs2-release v1.126.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cflinuxfs2-release/releases/tag/v1.126.0).\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT**: If you are opting into use of the Locket component in the Diego manifest generated by the scripts and templates in this release, you must provide the SQL connection parameters for Locket in a new `sql_overrides.locket` section of the stub file provided to the `-s` argument of the manifest-generation script. Previously, Locket reused the BBS component's SQL configuration. Existing deployments can copy the properties from `sql_overrides.bbs` to preserve continuity, but in general we recommend that Locket use a separate \"locket\" database from the \"diego\" database that the BBS uses.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Significant changes\r\n\r\n#### BBS API\r\n\r\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect the local route-emitters to receive only the ActualLRP events that are relevant for their cell ID in order to reduce the aggregate amount of ActualLRP event data that the BBS sends](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/145315183)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Instance Identity Credentials (Experimental)\r\n\r\n- [As a CF application, I expect the instance-identity certificate to have KU and EKU extensions set for client and server auth](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/145570007)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Manifest Generation\r\n\r\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect to be able to use separate database parameters for locket via the manifest-generation scripts, defaulting to \"locket\"](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/145242331) (in flight)\r\n- [As a Diego operator, I would like to be able to generate a Diego manifest with only minimal arguments](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/146300449)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### App Logging and Metrics\r\n\r\n- [As a CF app developer, I expect an app instance crash event to contain the log output of the failed healthcheck that resulted in the crash](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/145539907)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BOSH job changes\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BOSH property changes\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BOSH link changes\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n"
