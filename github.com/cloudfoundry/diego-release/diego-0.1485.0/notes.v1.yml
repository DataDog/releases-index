Previously, these values were enclosed verbatim in single quotes, which prevented most interpolation of special characters. This choice of escaping would in some cases disallow operators from using the single-quote character `'` itself, or would silently cause their removal (for example, turning `qu'ot'es` into `quotes`). With this release, these values are preserved as intended from the manifest via shell-escaping. We expect this change should affect very few operators, and certainly not those using only alphanumeric characters and spaces in their passphrases, but nevertheless please verify that your encryption key data is rendered correctly when you upgrade to this release.\n\n#### BBS Relational Datastore\n- [Fix segfault in BBS SQL task converger](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/129479471)\n\n#### Container Placement\n- [As a Diego operator, I should be able to configure my Cells with placement tags](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/129370081)\n- [As a BBS API client, I should be able to specify placement tags on DesiredLRPs](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/129370085)\n- [As a BBS API client, I should be able to specify placement tags on Tasks](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/129370087)\n- [As a Diego operator, I should be able to configure my Cells with both required and optional placement tags](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/129370091)\n- [Desired LRPs and Tasks should not allow negative memory/disk limits.](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/129728807)\n\n#### Container Execution\n- [As an operator, I expect the cells to default to checking the health of an unhealthy instance every 2 seconds so that I reduce the process load on the cells](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/124599021)\n- [As an app developer, I expect Diego cells to shut my app instances down gracefully even if they are being stopped because the cell has hit its evacuation timeout](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/127452747)\n\n#### `cfdot`\n- [As a cfdot user, I expect to be able to list all the ActualLRPGroups for a particular DesiredLRP](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126537075)\n- [As a cfdot user, I expect to be able to list all the ActualLRPGroups for a particular DesiredLRP at a particular index](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126537077)\n- [As a cfdot user, I expect to be able to retire a particular ActualLRP instance by process guid and index](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126537079)\n\n#### Routing\n- [operator should be able to consume additional metrics for gorouter via firehose](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/109774972)\n\n#### Azure Support\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect to be able to opt-in to auto-configuration of the rep's zone from its Azure FD only when available](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/128198027)\n\n#### Manifest Generation\n- [Remove legacy and unused config properties from Loggregator components](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/117777293)\n- [As an operator, I should be able to use special characters in my BBS encryption keys and labels](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/124451081)\n- [cloudfoundry/diego-release #191: Merge arbitrary garden linux properties.](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/129293449)\n- [cloudfoundry/diego-release #193: Fix template generation for garden-runc versions](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/129576687)\n\n#### Dependencies\n- [Use the garden runner to run guardian instead of the one in inigo](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126743343)\n\n#### Test Suites and Tooling\n- [Fix inigo builds after rep shutdown changes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/129428449)\n\n#### Cleanup\n- [As a BBS client, I would like the old LRP events endpoint no longer to be deprecated so that I can be assured of its continued existence](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126472183)\n\n#### De-Incubation\n- [Move/Remove `cloudfoundry-incubator` and `pivotal-golang` repos from diego-release.](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/124913851)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nNone.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n- Added `diego.rep.placement_tags`: List of placement tags for the cell rep to advertise and require of workloads. \n- Added `diego.rep.optional_placement_tags`: List of placement tags for the cell rep to advertise, but not to require of workloads.\n"
