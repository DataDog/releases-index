  "Content": "## Changes from v0.1454.0 to v0.1455.0\n- Depends on [garden-linux-release v0.334.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux-release/releases/tag/v0.334.0).\n- Depends on [etcd-release v36](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/v36).\n\n### Significant changes\n\nThis version of diego-release completely removes the Diego Acceptance Test suite, or DATs. This test suite had already been largely consolidated with the [CF Acceptance Tests](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-acceptance-tests), or CATs. CF v231 contains a version of the CATs that can be targeted at either the Diego backend or the DEAs, and which includes all the remaining tests of Diego-specific functionality from the DATs. The CATs are now the only supported mechanism for verifying the CF-level functionality of a CF deployment backed by Diego. Please consult the [CATs README](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-acceptance-tests) for more details on running it with the appropriate configuration.\n\nThe [Diego Smoke Tests](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-smoke-tests) are also redundant with the [CF Smoke Tests](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-smoke-tests), and will similarly be removed in favor of the CF tests in an upcoming release. If you are using the Diego Smoke Tests to monitor a CF deployment backed by Diego, please switch to using the CF Smoke Tests as soon as possible.\n\n#### BBS Benchmarks\n- [As a Diego developer, I expect the Diego BBS-benchmark test suite to include per-record reads and writes in the rep bulk loop](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113854839)\n- [LRPConvergence, route-emitter, and Nysnc bulk loops should operate on their default intervals in the benchmark-bbs suite](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113318841)\n\n#### Performance\n- [Spike: evaluate the performance of the relational-db-backed BBS against an HA deployment of cf-mysql](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113340231) (in flight)\n\n#### Custom CAs\n- [As a CF user, I expect trusted certificates to be available to cflinuxfs2- and Docker-image app instances in a conventional location](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113241421)\n\n#### SSH\n- [Bump diego-ssh in windows_app_lifecycle](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113658621)\n- [As a CF user, I expect that an SSH session into a CF instance should have same environment that the app process does (Take 2)](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113237191)\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-ssh #20: Use updated sftp Server constructor](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114219575)\n- [SSH-Proxy authenticators should check more strictly for guid fields in user names](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114226245)\n- [Fix data race in diego-ssh ssh-proxy.](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113507169)\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-ssh #18: add flags for specifying allowed cipher,mac,kex algorithms](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113921903)\n\n#### CF Tasks\n- [As a space developer, I expect the 'source' for task logging to be [App/TASK/TASK_NAME]](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/111472198)\n- [When CC misses a task callback when Diego completes a task, the task result should eventually be updated.](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/111472526)\n- [As a space developer, I can cancel a task](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/111473134)\n- [When Diego misses a task cancel when CC deletes or cancels task, send another cancel to Diego](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112252439)\n\n#### Routing\n- [Diego-release route_emitter ctl script should properly encode NATS password](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/111846095)\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/nsync #6: Dont populate cf-routes if CC does not send routes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113509449)\n- [operator should be able to discover whether the number of events sent by route-emitter is different from the number received by gorouter](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112189683) (in flight)\n\n#### Windows Support\n- [System log errors due to missing IIS log directory](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114037675)\n\n#### Manifest Generation\n- [Add new `graph_cleanup_threshold_in_mb` in manifest generation for cf-linux-release v334](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114330471)\n\n#### Dependencies\n- [Upgrade cflinuxfs2 rootfs in diego-release to 1.37.0+](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114258047)\n\n#### Test Suites and Tooling\n- [Deprecate the DATs and remove from diego-release](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/111154062)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n- Removed the `acceptance-tests` job.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n- Removed all BOSH properties under `acceptance_tests`.\n- Added `benchmark-bbs.percent_writes` property: Percentage of actual LRPs to write on each rep bulk loop in the BBS benchmarks.\n- Added `diego.rep.trusted_certs` property: Bundle of trusted certificates to be made available to all containers on the cell.\n"
