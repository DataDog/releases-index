The [diego-release repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release) has already moved, as have most of the other repositories that do not contain Golang code. Those code repositories will also be moving soon, but will also be updated to use `code.cloudfoundry.org` as their preferred import-path domain. If you import those Golang packages in your own code, please be aware that you will have to update those import paths (and possibly package names) as well.\n\n#### BBS Relational Datastore (Experimental)\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect the time-rotor benchmark deployment to be backed by an HA CF-MySQL deployment so that the published BBS benchmark data pertain to this DB configuration](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113854837)\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect the BBS to recover from catastrophic data loss in the relational store so that the system remains functional](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/121411037) (in flight)\n\n#### Performance\n- [Update performance-testing protocol for 250K-instance, 1000+-cell end-to-end performance test](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/119290581)\n\n#### Performance Tuning\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect that if the BBS has no LRPs to auction after LRP convergence, it should not send a request to the auctioneer](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/119562007)\n\n#### SSH\n- [Add CC admin scope to ssh-proxy uaa client in all documented stubs for CF/Diego deployments](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/117668091)\n\n#### Manifest Generation\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release #170: Allow bridge components to load from capi release with -b flag](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/122152337)\n- [Remove the `enable_graph_cleanup` property from manifest generation.](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114330709)\n\n#### Component Logging and Metrics\n- [Add metrics and logging to volman](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/121514319)\n\n#### Security\n- [As a CF user, I would like Diego to validate the SHA checksum of my droplet before running it](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/110124086)\n\n#### Documentation\n- [Document the public LRP API and related types on the BBS](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115611661)\n\n#### Cleanup\n- [Remove unused vendored dependencies from diego-release](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114368887)\n\n#### De-Incubation\n- [As a CF contributor, I expect to find non-Golang-code Diego repositories in the cloudfoundry organization](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/121931133)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nNone.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n\nNone.\n"
