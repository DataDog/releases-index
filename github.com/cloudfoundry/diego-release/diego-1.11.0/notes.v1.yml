If using the manifest-generation script in diego-release, these properties must now be configured via the `property_overrides.cc_uploader.cc.ca_cert`, `client_cert`, and `client_key` properties. The [`generate-cc-uploader-certs` script](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/blob/v1.11.0/scripts/generate-cc-uploader-certs) will generate these credentials via `certstrap`.\r\n\r\n### Significant changes\r\n\r\n#### BBS Relational Datastore\r\n\r\n- [Remove ineffective isolation-level setting logic from BBS and locket main routines](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/138957301)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Local Route Emitters\r\n\r\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect to be able to opt the cell-local route-emitters into registering TCP routes with the routing API when authorization is disabled](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/140323935)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Dependencies\r\n\r\n- [Bump garden submodule](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/141641843)\r\n- [Update ginkgo/gomega libraries](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/142522481)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Test Suites and Tooling\r\n\r\n- [Monitor vizzini flakiness after removing the test in vizzini that creates too many processes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/141640677)\r\n- [Fix a race condition in executor](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/141722493)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Security\r\n\r\n- [CC-Uploader: uploading droplets and polling happens over an endpoint using mtls](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/139996781)\r\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect that the cell rep can participate in mutual TLS exchanges for HTTPS downloads and uploads](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/140818681)\r\n\r\n\r\n### BOSH job changes\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### BOSH property changes\r\n\r\n- Deprecated `diego.executor.ca_certs_for_downloads` in favor of rep-scoped `tls.ca_cert` property.\r\n\r\n#### `rep` and `rep_windows`\r\n\r\n- Added `tls.ca_cert`: CA certificates for rep server to trust for downloads and uploads.\r\n- Added `tls.cert`: Certificate for rep client to present in downloads and uploads.\r\n- Added `tls.key`: Private key for rep client to use in downloads and uploads.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### `route_emitter` and `route_emitter_windows`\r\n\r\n- Added `tcp.enabled`: Whether to enable emission of TCP routes through the routing API.\r\n- Added `routing_api.uri`: URI of the Routing API.\r\n- Added `routing_api.port`: Port of the Routing API.\r\n- Added `routing_api.auth_disabled`: Whether to use UAA authentication to communicate with the Routing API.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BOSH link changes\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n"
