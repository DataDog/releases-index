  "Content": "## Changes from v0.1452.0 to v0.1453.0\n- Depends on [garden-linux-release v0.332.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux-release/releases/tag/v0.332.0).\n- Depends on [etcd-release v33](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/WWW).\n\nNote that due to breaking changes in manifest-generation introduced in cf-release, the manifest-generation scripts in this version of diego-release are compatible only with [cf-release@0665d0e](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/commit/0665d0ee376f178f8552a786e8e35a42b3e5dbdc) or later. Those scripts are therefore incompatible with CF v230 or earlier, but will be compatible with CF v231 when it is released.\n\n### Significant changes\n\n#### BBS Benchmarks\n- [As a Diego developer, I would like the BBS benchmark suite to run periodic rep bulk retrieval loops](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/111842773)\n\n#### Manifest Generation\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release #128: Update loggregator and metron properties to match latest loggregator](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113127429)\n- [Change bosh property names for loggregator TLS certs to \"standard format\"](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112639903)\n\n#### Component Logging and Metrics\n- [The route-emitter should log and emit metrics if it detects two distinct instances with the same address in its in-memory routing table](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112193855)\n\n#### Test Suites and Tooling\n- [As a Diego operator, I would like a script to generate a vizzini errand manifest for my Diego deployment](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112343977) (in flight)\n- [Investigate recent flakiness in unit tests](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113384069)\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release #134: Fixed broken link](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113499125)\n\n#### Cleanup\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release #131: remove stale entries in .gitmodules](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113290757)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nNone.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n\nNone.\n"
