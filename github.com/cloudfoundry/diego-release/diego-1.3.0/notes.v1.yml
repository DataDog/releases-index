  "Content": "## Changes from v1.2.0 to v1.3.0\n- Verified with [garden-runc-release v1.0.4](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-runc-release/releases/tag/v1.0.4).\n- Verified with [garden-windows-bosh-release v0.1.0](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/garden-windows-bosh-release/releases/tag/v0.1.0).\n- Verified with [etcd-release v87](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/v87).\n- Verified with [cf-mysql-release v32](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release/releases/tag/v32).\n- Verified with [cflinuxfs2-rootfs-release v1.43.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cflinuxfs2-rootfs-release/releases/tag/v1.43.0).\n\n**IMPORTANT**: **DO NOT USE** this version of Diego if you set the `diego.executor.disk_capacity_mb` or `diego.executor.memory_capacity_mb` BOSH properties to explicit numeric values, instead of relying on the `\"auto\"` default. The configuration refactoring of the cell rep in [story #135348391](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/135348391) accidentally introduced a regression that prevents the cell rep from starting with these numeric values configured. The Diego team will release Diego v1.3.1 with a fix as soon as possible.\n\n### Significant changes\n\n#### Routing\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect the HTTP route-emitter to stop registering routes for evacuating instances as early as is safely possible](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/134698439)\n\n#### Local Route Emitters (Experimental)\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect to be able to run the route-emitter in an experimental cell-local mode](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/134710137)\n\n#### Dependencies\n- [Update to Golang v1.7.4+ in diego-release](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/135454503)\n\n#### Test Suites and Tooling\n- [As a Diego operator, I expect the examples/aws bosh-init instructions to include configuration for a health-monitor user so that the health monitor can send appropriately tagged metrics to datadog](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/130869759)\n- [As a CF operator, I expect the AWS examples to include instructions for generating and using UAA and loggregator TLS credentials](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/134663343) (in flight)\n- [Investigate a hanging cfdot integration test](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/135881281)\n\n#### Security\n- [The bbs can respond to staging callbacks directly to the cc with Mutual TLS](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/135655951)\n\n#### Cleanup\n- [Convert the rep to use a JSON configuration file rather than command line flags.](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/135348391)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nNone.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n- Added `diego.rep.job_name`: Used to distinguish between the rep and rep_windows jobs.\n- Added `diego.route_emitter.local_mode`: Experimental flag to enable cell-local mode for the route-emitter job.\n"
