  "Content": "## PostgreSQL version upgrade\r\nThis release upgrades PostgreSQL to version 9.6.2.\r\n**NOTE**: this drops support for upgrading from PostgreSQL 9.4.5.\r\nOnly upgrades from PostgreSQL 9.4.6 and 9.4.9 are supported. \r\n\r\nConsiderations before deploying:\r\n- A copy of the database is made for the upgrade, you may need to adjust the persistent disk capacity of the postgres job.\r\n- The upgrade happens as part of the monit start and its duration may vary basing on your env. The postgres monit start timeout can be adjusted using property `databases.monit_timeout`. You may need to specify a higher value if you have a large database. The `pg_upgrade` utility is used to upgrade.\r\n- Postgres will be unavailable during this upgrade.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth old and new databases are kept. The old database is moved to `/var/vcap/store/postgres/postgres-previous`. \r\nThe postgres-previous directory will be kept until the next postgres upgrade is performed in the future. You are free to remove this if you have verified the new database works and you want to reclaim the space.\r\n\r\nIn case of issues during the upgrade, refer to the [Upgrading](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release/blob/master/README.md#upgrading) section of the README.\r\n\r\n## Job spec changes\r\nThe default value for the `databases.monit_timeout` has been changed to 90 seconds.\r\n"
