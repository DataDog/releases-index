  "Content": "...this release:\r\n\r\n# New Features\r\n\r\n* Adds a new flag, called `--rootless`, to `grootfs init-store`. By calling `grootfs init-store --rootless user:group` you can create a store owned by a non-root user.\r\n  - The new store will use UID and GID mappings found in `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid`.\r\n* Makes `grootfs init-store` use the underlying XFS filesystem if `--store-size-bytes` is passed with value `0`.\r\n  - No need to always create a loop device.\r\n* Introduces a new BOSH property, called `grootfs-diagnostics.use_persistent_disk`, which instructs GrootFS to use the underlying persistent disk for its store.\r\n  - BOSH persistent disks are mounted in `/var/vcap/store`.\r\n  - BOSH jobs need to require the persistent disk to be formatted as an XFS filesystem.\r\n\r\n# Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fixes a concurrency / idempotency issue found in `grootfs clean` and `grootfs create --with-clean`.\r\n* Fixes short id collision for the Overlay-XFS driver.\r\n* Cleans up `projectids` in the Overlay-XFS driver."
