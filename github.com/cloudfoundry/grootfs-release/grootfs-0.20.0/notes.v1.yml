  "Content": "* Extends `grootfs init-store` to take care of creating and mounting a backing filesystem for the store. The optional flag `--store-size-bytes` controls the size of the filesystem.\r\n* Drops `--uid-mapping` and `--gid-mapping` from `grootfs create`. The UID and GID mappings for the store must now be specified as part of `grootfs init-store`.\r\n* Makes GrootFS able to optionally report an extensive set of system metrics that are aimed to help us study and improve the way GrootFS uses XFS.\r\n* Improves store validation logic.\r\n* Removes functionality that was lazily initializing the store upon first `grootfs create` call.\r\n* Introduces the `grootfs-debug` BOSH job which is designed to store XFS internal logs when it finds processes being in D state (disk wait or uninterruptible sleep) for a long time. This is to help us investigate further issues with stuck D-state processes that we have experienced in production environments.\r\n* Adds migration path for old (pre-v0.20.0) store formats."
