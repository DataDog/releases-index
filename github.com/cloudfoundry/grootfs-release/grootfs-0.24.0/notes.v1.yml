  "Content": "This release was meant to be **v0.22.0** but due to [Github](https://status.github.com/messages/2017-07-31) and subsequent CI issues we had to jump some release numbers.\r\n\r\nThis release...\r\n\r\n* Uses SHA256 checksums in the BOSH release.\r\n* Removes unnecessary cache flushing from `grootfs stats`. This should improve general file system performance in Grooted Diego cells. \r\n* Includes some more work on the rootless use case for Overlay-XFS:\r\n  - Local tar-balls can be used with disk quotas.\r\n  - Metrics can be obtained."
