  "Content": "* Verified with [grootfs-release v0.17.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/grootfs-release/releases/tag/v0.17.0)\r\n\r\nHappy spring-time holidays garden fans! v1.5.0 has only a couple small changes, but please note the new `process.Wait()` behaviour if you create lots of processes in a single container (see below).\r\n\r\n## Less Weighty Wait\r\n\r\n* Wait() no longer silently deletes the process state, which means it's now safe to call `attach()` and `wait()` multiple times. The process state is cleaned up when the container is destroyed instead.\r\n* **Clients that create large numbers of processes in a single container will want to opt-back-in to the old behaviour by setting the `garden.cleanup_process_dirs_on_wait` bosh property to true.**\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fixed a regression in resolv.conf processing introduced in 1.3.0"
