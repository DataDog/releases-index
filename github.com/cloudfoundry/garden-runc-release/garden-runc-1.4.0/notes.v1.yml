  "Content": "* Verified with [grootfs-release v0.15.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/grootfs-release/releases/tag/v0.15.0)\r\n\r\nHi Gardeneers!\r\n\r\nGRR v1.4.0 mostly introduces some changes to the network plugin API and introduces a first-pass experimental ability to limit container block IO. Please, contain your enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n## Network Plugin / Networking Changes\r\n\r\n- We now allow the network plugin to return a set of DNS servers which we will ensure are set on the container's resolv.conf. This allows DNS policy to be set by the network plugin if enabled.\r\n- When the network plugin is not enabled, there's now an `additional_dns_servers` property that allows specifying extra DNS servers which should be appended to any inherited from resolv.conf or set to the `dns_servers` property.\r\n- `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf` are now bind-mounted in to the container rather than being written in a chroot. This interacts better with user namespaces and rootless containers and is generally more simple and secure.\r\n- We no longer set up the built-in networkers iptable chains when an external network plugin is enabled, to avoid confusion caused by two things both creating iptable state on the host\r\n- Log messages from `NetOut(log=true)` rules now properly truncate handles so that space separation is preserved when the handle is longer than 29 characters\r\n\r\n\r\n## BlockIO Limiting (Experimental)\r\n\r\n- We've added an experimental [`default_container_blockio_weight`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-release/blob/develop/jobs/garden/spec#L59) property to allow assigning a blockio weight to all containers created by garden. This requires the CFQ scheduler to be enabled to be useful and applies to all garden-created containers on the host. The feature is being released experimentally via the bosh property, feedback welcome!\r\n\r\n## Rootless Mode\r\n\r\n- You can now follow the [updated experimental rootless mode doc](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-release/blob/develop/docs/rootless-containers.md) to add networking support to your rootless containers.\r\n"
