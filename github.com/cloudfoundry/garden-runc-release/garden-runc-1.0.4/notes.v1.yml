  "Content": "- Verified with [grootfs-release v0.6.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/grootfs-release/releases/tag/v0.6.0)\n\nHi garden consumers! We're pleased to present a fresh new garden release with the following great new features:\n- Fixed significant performance degradation for long-running deployments (due to a memory leak in a dependency).\n- Support for a new [ContainerSpec.Limits.Pid.Max field](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden/blob/6377620076f922785b2934ec0fd3d03b34ad8c4d/client.go#L153) to limit max processes in a container (note: uses new PID cgroup, requires 4.4+ kernels)\n- No default for [`debug_listen_address`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-release/blob/develop/jobs/garden/spec#L48) property any more - default is not to listen. If you wish to enable debugging, you should explicitly opt in.\n- We now use the `iptables-restore` packaged in the bosh release rather than relying on whatever's in the base OS\n- Improvements to network_plugin API for BulkNetOut\n- Improvements to image_plugin API. Now testing against [grootfs](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/grootfs-release) in pipeline and listing compatible versions in these very release notes.\n\nYou will notice that these very release notes now list compatible versions of [grootfs](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/grootfs-release). These are the releases we have tested this version of garden-runc against. GrootFS is the new Garden Root Filesystem management component. We intend to eventually deprecate the built-in rootfs management in Garden in favour of GrootFS. At this point GrootFS is (very) experimental, but those who wish to test with it can find instructions in [the grootfs-release repo](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/grootfs-release). We will officially deprecate the built-in rootfs manager and then give a timeline for its removal in later releases.\n\nHappy Gardening!\n"
