  "Content": "This release supports all features required to replace Garden-Linux in a Cloud Foundry deployment for development or testing. Performance with production workloads at scale has not yet been validated, so we don't recommend using this in production.\n\nYou can find a guide to transitioning from Garden-Linux to Garden-RunC [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-docs/blob/master/transition-guide.md).\n\nThis release may or may not be suitable for non Cloud Foundry use, depending on the set of features required. Notably, a number of features do not yet work correctly across server restarts. Support for specifying container IPs and subnets is also not yet implemented.\n"
