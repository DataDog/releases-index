  "Content": "The cf-release v236 was released on April 26, 2016.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\n- Diego bridge components are now in CAPI-Release, submoduled into CF-Release. They are removed from the upcoming version of Diego, [v0.1469.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release/releases/tag/v0.1469.0) and will need to be sourced from CF-Release. Users of Diego manifest generation scripts can wait for this to happen automatically. Users that generate their Diego deployment manifest manually can make this change now. See \u003ca href='#job-spec-changes'\u003eJob Spec Changes\u003c/a\u003e.\n- As part of moving Diego bridge components to CAPI-Release, properties for bridge components in Diego deployment manifests will be sourced from `properties.capi` in addition to `properties.diego`. We intend to only support `properties.capi` for CF-238. Users of Diego manifest generation scripts can wait for this to happen automatically. Users that generate their Diego deployment manifest manually can make this change now.
