Diego-release 1.14.0 includes the ability to configure that property.\r\n- Changes in some jobs require using a BOSH Director v258 or newer.\r\n- Changing the number of instances of doppler with restart Traffic Controllers resulting in disruption in Firehose throughput.\r\n- The included version of Loggregator restricts ciphers to use only the following 4 ciphers. This is a breaking change for some operators and a configurable property for opting into more cipher suites was introduced in Loggregator 85\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\n\r\n## \u003ca name='job-spec-changes'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Job Spec Changes\r\n- The cc_uploader job has new required properties.
