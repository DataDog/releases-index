  "Content": "The cf-release v204 was released on March 19th, 2015\n- Note cf-release is now 5.1 GB. BOSH Director's nginx has a 5GB limit on upload size.  If you are uploading cf-release into BOSH Director that has never before deployed cf, your upload will fail.  Instructions for modifying this configuration on BOSH Director [here](https://groups.google.com/a/cloudfoundry.org/d/msg/bosh-users/gk25-iV3UlY/AmP-TIzf7qUJ). For BOSH-Lite [here](https://groups.google.com/a/cloudfoundry.org/d/msg/bosh-users/MjiFAdpyimQ/VeOCpG9SsHQJ)  The buildpacks team has a skinny buildpacks [epic](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/epic/show/1747328) that should help with this issue.\n\n### Runtime\n- Upgrading php buildpack to v3.1.0 [details](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/php-buildpack/releases/tag/v3.1.0)\n- Upgrading ruby buildpack to v1.3.0 [details](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/ruby-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.3.0)\n- Upgrading python buildpack to v1.2.0 [details](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/python-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.2.0) \n- Upgrading nodejs buildpack to v1.2.0 [details](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.2.0)\n- Upgrading go buildpack to v1.2.0 [details](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.2.0)\n- [Experimental] Work continues on support for Asynchronous Service Instance Operations [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/epic/show/1561148)\n  - Bug fixed to prevent long-lived service instances from getting stuck in \"update in progress\" on bind or unbind [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/90532156)\n- [Experimental] Work continues on /v3 and Application Process Types [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/epic/show/1334418)\n- [Experimental] Work continues on Route API [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/epic/show/1590160)\n- [Experimental] Reverting ca-truster job for adding custom CA Certificates to the trust store on vms in cf-release  \n- Recursive deletion of a space no longer aborts after first failure to delete a resource within (deleting all resources that can be deleted) and deletion of service instances and bindings are not rolled back, preventing orphans. Deletion of applications during recursive deletion of a space remains in a transaction; failure to delete one app will roll back deletion of all apps in the space. \n- You can now configure `dea_next.allow_host_access` property in cf-release manifest. [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/85565064)\n  - This allows containers on the same host to be able to communicate with each other assuming security groups allow it.\n- Change v2 directory server port to 32766 [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/87576478)\n- Add `-W interactive` to awk so that it does not buffer writing to stdout/stderr [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/90230214)\n- Update rootfs blobs in cf-release.
