You'll need to provide the certificate and key for the CA that was used to sign the other loggregator certs. The _certificate_ for that CA can also be found in [`loggregator.tls.ca`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/blob/v253/templates/cf.yml#L690). Deployers should have the private key stored securely.\r\n- The included version of Loggregator restricts ciphers to use only the following 4 ciphers. This is a breaking change for some operators and a configurable property for opting into more cipher suites was introduced in Loggregator 85\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\n\r\n## \u003ca name='cves'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eCVEs\r\n- None\r\n\r\n## \u003ca name='subcomponent-updates'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSubcomponent Updates\r\n- Cloud Controller and Service Broker API:\r\n  - [capi-release 1.21.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.21.0)\r\n- Identity:\r\n  - [uaa-release v27](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa-release/releases/tag/v27)\r\n- Routing:\r\n  - [routing-release 0.146.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/routing-release/releases/tag/0.146.0)\r\n- Loggregator:\r\n  - [loggregator v79](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/releases/tag/v79)\r\n- Buildpacks and Stacks:\r\n  - Java: \r\n    - [java-buildpack v3.13](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/releases/tag/v3.13)\r\n  - Ruby: \r\n    - [ruby-buildpack v1.6.34](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/ruby-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.6.34)\r\n  - Go: \r\n    - [go-buildpack v1.7.18](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.7.18)\r\n  - Node.js: \r\n    - [nodejs-buildpack v1.5.29](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.5.29)\r\n  - Python: \r\n    - [python-buildpack v1.5.15](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/python-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.5.15)\r\n  - PHP: \r\n    - [php-buildpack v4.3.26](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/php-buildpack/releases/tag/v4.3.26)\r\n    - [php-buildpack v4.3.27](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/php-buildpack/releases/tag/v4.3.27)\r\n  - Staticfile: \r\n    - [staticfile-buildpack v1.3.17](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/staticfile-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.3.17)\r\n  - Binary: \r\n    - [binary-buildpack v1.0.8](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/binary-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.0.8)\r\n    - [binary-buildpack v1.0.9](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/binary-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.0.9)\r\n  - .Net Core: \r\n    - [dotnet-core-buildpack v1.0.11](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/dotnet-core-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.0.11)\r\n  - Stacks: \r\n    - [stacks 1.100.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stacks/releases/tag/1.100.0)\r\n    - [stacks 1.101.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stacks/releases/tag/1.101.0)\r\n    - [stacks 1.103.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stacks/releases/tag/1.103.0)\r\n    - [stacks 1.104.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stacks/releases/tag/1.104.0)\r\n- Consul:\r\n  - no changes\r\n- Etcd:\r\n  - [etcd-release v93](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/v93)\r\n  - [etcd-release v92](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/v92)\r\n  - [etcd-release v91](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/v91)\r\n- NATS:\r\n  - No changes.\r\n- Postgres:\r\n  - No changes.\r\n- DEA-Warden-HM9000:\r\n  - No changes.\r\n\r\n## \u003ca name='compatible-releases-and-stemcells'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eCompatible Releases and Stemcells\r\n- Diego release [v1.8.1](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/tree/v1.8.1).
