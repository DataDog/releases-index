  "Content": "The cf-release v234 was released on April 06, 2016.\n\n**Important:**\n- v234 includes a fix to a performance regression in Gorouter introduced in v228. At low request volume, the issue is not observable; only at higher request volumes (such as a load test) is the regression evident. The regression was the result of a change in the library used for logging in Gorouter and support being added for syslog streaming of access logs. A new manifest property `router.enable_access_log_streaming` may now be used to optionally enable support for streaming of access logs to syslog; this property is `false` by default. When enabled, the same performance degradation can be observed. We will further investigate the cause of this performance issue. \n- V234 includes a fix to the problem in V233 where there was a potential for only delivering partial sets of log messages for an app, or to the firehose.\n- In v217, the `consul_agent` job introduced support for securing all network traffic related to Consul.  In this release, it is now mandatory to configure the `consul_agent` processes to run in this secure mode.  If you have been previously running in an insecure mode, you will need to orchestrate an upgrade from an insecure cluster to a secure cluster.  Refer to the **Important** section of the [v217 release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/releases/tag/v217) for instructions on how to do this.\n\n**Contents:**\n- \u003ca href='#cc-and-service-broker-apis'\u003eCC and Service Broker APIs\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#dea-warden-hm9000-runtime'\u003eDEA-Warden-HM9000 Runtime\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#buildpacks-and-stacks'\u003eBuildpacks and Stacks\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#identity'\u003eIdentity\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#routing'\u003eRouting\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#loggregator'\u003eLoggregator\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#internal-components'\u003eInternal Components\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#job-spec-changes'\u003eJob Spec Changes\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#recommended-bosh-stemcell-versions'\u003eRecommended BOSH Stemcell Versions\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#recommended-diego-release-version'\u003eRecommended diego-release Version\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#recommended-garden-linux-release-version'\u003eRecommended garden-linux-release Version\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#recommended-etcd-release-version'\u003eRecommended etcd-release Version\u003c/a\u003e\n\n## \u003ca name='cc-and-service-broker-apis'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eCC and Service Broker APIs\n\n**CC API Version: [2.53.0](http://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/234)**\n\n**Service Broker API Version: [2.8](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html)**\n\n**IMPORTANT**\n- [Operators can configure the WebDAV blobstore client with a custom CA](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116370901), however, during Cloud Controller startup we wait for the blobstore to become available using curl and system trusted certificates, including those configured to be added by bosh. We plan on making a fix in CF-235 such that this won't depend on the system trusted certificates.\n- [CCDB migration](cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng#569) could take significant time for databases containing large number of app usage events. This is mostly mitigated as app usage events are cleaned up per `cc.app_usage_events.cutoff_age_in_days`. We were able to complete this migration in under 90s for ~500k app_usage_events on a production deployment replica. Operators can increase `canary_watch_time` to allow more time for migration.\n- Work to [fix deletion of an app while staging on Diego](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112562131) introduced a regression in the ability to delete an app while staging on DEA. Fix is planned for CF-235.\n- Work to move Diego CC-Bridge components to CAPI Release is underway. No changes are necessary at this point as the components will still come from Diego release when using our manifest generation scripts.\n\n#### [CAPI Release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/tree/d42fc42fc72133754280d305a9cc0bf7d11d1960)\n- Diego CC-Bridge components are in CAPI Release [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113941499)\n- As an operator, I can configure the blobstore webdav client with a CA cert bundle [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116370901)\n- Migrating to WebDAV with large blobstore does not require `chown -r` [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116176983)\n- Blobstore internal is always TLS, update spec to indicate https [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116090167)\n- WebDAV blobstore supports long system domain [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115516981)\n\n#### [Cloud Controller](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/tree/f97457f04e967a43e9de1c359ab01d1b1fdf7324)\n- As a CF user, I expect to be able to delete an app while it is staging on Diego [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112562131)\n- As an operator, I can configure the blobstore webdav client with a CA cert bundle [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116370901)\n- as a CAPI developer, I would like a way to configure bosh-lite to route requests to CC to my local CC [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116049399)\n- Bump fog to lastest, v1.37.0+ [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115793253)\n- Experimental: CC can start DEA applications over https [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112002995)\n- V3 Experimental\n  - Move all /v3/apps related docs to the new docs [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114296345)\n  - Move all /v3/droplets related docs to the new docs [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114296253)\n  - Move all /v3/package related docs to the new docs [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114296163)\n  - Move all /v3/processes related docs to the new docs [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114296155)\n  - As an auditor, I expect app usage events for V3 process STARTED to record the buildpack_guid that was used to stage the droplet.

name='routing'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eRouting\n- Gorouter performance regression resolved by not streaming access logs to syslog by default. This regression was introduced in v228. Thanks to SAP for alerting us of the issue. Access logs continue to be logged locally. [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115261403)\n- Access logs may be optionally streamed to syslog with new manifest property `router.enable_access_log_streaming`. With high request volume, this does effect performance. We will be investigating the cause of this [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116491715)\n- Gorouter now logs start messages with millisecond granularity [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115938809)\n- Gorouter now connects to UAA using TLS when fetching a token for communicating with Routing API [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/109654250)\n- Gorouter logs now clearly show when it fetches a token from UAA for communicating with Routing API  [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116264949)\n- Fixed a bug in Gorouter whereby absolute URIs were being decoded before route lookup [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/111471330)\n- property `router.enable_routing_api` has been replaced by new property `routing_api.enabled`, which now manages both cc and gorouter behavior regarding Routing API [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115965445)\n- Fixed a regression that when dockerfile exposes multiple ports, port 8080 is mapped to the route instead of the lowest port. Previous behavior is restored [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115008087)\n\n## \u003ca name='loggregator'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eLoggregator\n- Fixed a defect where Traffic Controllers would hang on their connection to Dopplers.\n- Reworked metronbenchmark tool to add features for performance testing of Metron.\n\n## \u003ca name='internal-components'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eInternal Components\n\n#### consul\n- consul-release was bumped from v65 to [v75](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/consul-release/releases/tag/v75)\n- consul now uses Golang 1.6 [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116174561)\n- consul now only supports encrypted modes of operation, requiring TLS and gossip encryption configuration. [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115983261)\n- consul allows operator configuration of the base domain used for service discovery; this configuration is mandatory. [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114803375)\n\n#### etcd and etcd-metrics-server\n- etcd-release was bumped from v38 to [v42](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/v42).\n- etcd and etcd-metrics-server now use Golang 1.6 [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116174561)\n- etcd allows operator configuration of the advertisement DNS suffix; this configuration is mandatory. [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115002695), [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115962757)\n\n## \u003ca name='job-spec-changes'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eJob Spec Changes\n- WebDAV blobstore can be configured to use a custom ca: `cc.resource_pool.webdav_config.ca_cert`, `cc.packages.webdav_config.ca_cert`, `cc.droplets.webdav_config.ca_cert`, `cc.buildpacks.webdav_config.ca_cert`\n- **EXPERIMENTAL**: DEA can be configured to use HTTPS: `cc.dea_use_https`. This should remain `false` until work is completed on the DEA side.\n- Removed default value from `etcd.advertise_urls_dns_suffix` property of `etcd` job (previous default was `etcd.service.cf.internal`); this now needs to be specified explicitly in the manifest, and should generally be specified as the previous default value. [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115962757)\n- Removed `consul.require_ssl` property from `consul_agent` job (SSL configuration is now required). [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115983261)\n- Added `consul.agent.domain` property to `consul_agent` job; this property does not have a default and its configuration is required, typical deployments should set the value to `cf.internal`.
