If you're deploying netman-release (which is still experimental), there will be some necessary [changes to your manifest](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-networking-release/blob/develop/docs/manifest-changelog.md).\r\n- **Slow API responses during deployment:** Cloud Controller will be performing a migration on the events table to allow tracking additional user information on audit events. Because this table is often very large, some requests may be slower than normal.  Additionally, there is a change to background processing that may cause asynchronous requests such as app and space deletion to take slightly longer until workers finish deploying.\r\n- The default transport for `syslog_daemon_config` has changed from TCP to UDP for both the `metron_agent` and `metron_agent_windows` jobs. This change was done on the metron_agent_windows job to enable Windows to write syslog. The change was also made to the metron_agent job to remain consistent between the two. These changes result in the same behavior for mixed windows and linux deployments. If you require TCP transport for component logs, you will need to explicitly set the property `syslog_daemon_config.transport` to `tcp` in your deployment manifest. Otherwise your syslog server will have to be configured to accept syslog over UDP.\r\n- The included version of Loggregator restricts ciphers to use only the following 4 ciphers. This is a breaking change for some operators and a configurable property for opting into more cipher suites was introduced in Loggregator 85\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\n\r\n## \u003ca name='job-spec-changes'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Job Spec Changes\r\n- Cloud Controller now requires [SSL configuration](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/blob/develop/docs/tls-configuration.md) with the following properties, the CA cert should match the diego bbs ca cert and that ca cert should be used to sign the newly required public cert:\r\n  - `cc.mutual_tls.ca_cert`: PEM-encoded CA certificate for secure, mutually authenticated TLS communication\r\n  - `cc.mutual_tls.public_cert`: PEM-encoded certificate for secure, mutually authenticated TLS communication\r\n  - `cc.mutual_tls.private_key`: PEM-encoded key for secure, mutually authenticated TLS communication\r\n- [Postgres v10 job spec changes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release/releases/tag/v10)\r\n- Loggregator now requires properties set for mutual auth with Cloud Controller. This is used for retrieving application names for inclusion in syslog drains and is set with the following new properties. \r\n  - `loggregator.tls.syslogdrainbinder.cert`: TLS certificate for syslogdrainbinder, signed by diego bbs CA\r\n  - `loggregator.tls.syslogdrainbinder.key`:  TLS key for syslogdrainbinder, signed by diego bbs CA\r\n  - Use `\u003cdiego-bbs-ca.crt\u003e` and  `\u003cdiego-bbs-ca.key\u003e` when running `generate-loggregator-certs`. The diego BBS CA cert and key are typically generated separately from this script.\r\n  - See the Loggregator [README](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/blob/develop/README.md#generating-tls-certificates) for more details on the new flag\r\n\r\n## \u003ca name='cves'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eCVEs\r\n- Stacks version 1.99.0, included in v252, is vulnerable to [USN-3193-1](https://www.ubuntu.com/usn/USN-3193-1/)\r\n\r\n## \u003ca name='subcomponent-updates'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSubcomponent Updates\r\n- Cloud Controller and Service Broker API:\r\n  - [capi-release 1.16.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.16.0)\r\n  - [capi-release 1.17.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.17.0)\r\n  - [capi-release 1.18.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.18.0)\r\n  - [capi-release 1.19.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.19.0)\r\n  - [capi-release 1.20.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.20.0)\r\n- Identity:\r\n  - [uaa-release v25](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa-release/releases/tag/v25)\r\n- Routing:\r\n  - [routing-release 0.144.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/routing-release/releases/tag/0.144.0)\r\n- Loggregator:\r\n  - [loggregator v76](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/releases/tag/v76)\r\n- Buildpacks and Stacks:\r\n  - Java: [java-buildpack v3.12](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/releases/tag/v3.12)\r\n  - Ruby: [ruby-buildpack v1.6.32](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/ruby-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.6.32) (no change)\r\n  - Go: [go-buildpack v1.7.17](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.7.17) (no change)\r\n  - Node.js: [nodejs-buildpack v1.5.27](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.5.27) (no change)\r\n  - Python: [python-buildpack v1.5.14](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/python-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.5.14) (no change)\r\n  - PHP: [php-buildpack v4.3.25](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/php-buildpack/releases/tag/v4.3.25) (no change)\r\n  - Staticfile: [staticfile-buildpack v1.3.16](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/staticfile-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.3.16) (no change)\r\n  - Binary: [binary-buildpack v1.0.7](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/binary-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.0.7) (no change)\r\n  - .Net Core: [dotnet-core-buildpack v1.0.9](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/dotnet-core-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.0.9) (no change)\r\n  - Stacks: [stacks v1.99.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stacks/releases/tag/v1.99.0), [stacks v1.98.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stacks/releases/tag/v1.98.0), [stacks v1.97.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stacks/releases/tag/v1.97.0)\r\n- Consul:\r\n  - [consul-release v152](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/consul-release/releases/tag/v152)\r\n  - [consul-release v151](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/consul-release/releases/tag/v151)\r\n  - [consul-release v150](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/consul-release/releases/tag/v150)\r\n- Etcd:\r\n  - [etcd-release v90](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/v90)\r\n  - [etcd-release v89](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/v89)\r\n- NATS:\r\n  - No changes.\r\n- Postgres:\r\n  - [postgres-release v9](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release/releases/tag/v9)\r\n  - [postgres-release v10](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release/releases/tag/v10)\r\n  - [postgres-release v11](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release/releases/tag/v11)\r\n  - [postgres-release v13](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release/releases/tag/v13)\r\n- DEA-Warden-HM9000:\r\n  - No changes.\r\n\r\n## \u003ca name='compatible-releases-and-stemcells'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eCompatible Releases and Stemcells\r\n- Diego release [v1.6.2](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/tree/v1.6.2).
