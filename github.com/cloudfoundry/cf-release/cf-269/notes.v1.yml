There will be a five release period to perform a migration that does not impact API availability.  In release v274 we will enforce secure communication, and non-migrated environments will experience API downtime during deployment.  See this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pdxC1DqROqk72BDw--6b5v2r0K7Jpp9l-FbO6tlkQDs/edit?usp=sharing) for a full list of changes and deployment guidelines.\r\n- Several Loggregator metric names were updated for consistency. See the [Loggregator 91](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/statsd-injector-release/releases/tag/v1.0.29) release notes for details. \r\n\r\n## \u003ca name='v269-job-spec-changes'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Job Spec Changes\r\n- None\r\n\r\n## \u003ca name='v269-security-notices'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSecurity Notices\r\n\r\n### Affecting v269\r\n- None\r\n\r\n### Resolved in v269\r\n- None\r\n\r\n## \u003ca name='v269-subcomponent-updates'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSubcomponent Updates\r\n- Cloud Controller and Service Broker API:\r\n  - [capi-release 1.36.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.36.0)\r\n- Identity:\r\n  - [uaa-release v44](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa-release/releases/tag/v44)\r\n- Routing:\r\n  - [routing-release v0.159.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/routing-release/releases/tag/v0.159.0) (no change)\r\n- Loggregator:\r\n  - [loggregator v91](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/releases/tag/91)\r\n  - [statsd-injector-release 1.0.29](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/statsd-injector-release/releases/tag/v1.0.29)\r\n- Java Buildpack:\r\n  - [java-buildpack v3.19](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/releases/tag/v3.19)\r\n- Ruby Buildpack:\r\n  - [ruby-buildpack v1.6.44](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/ruby-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.6.45)\r\n- Go Buildpack:\r\n  - [go-buildpack v1.8.5](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.8.5) (no change)\r\n- Node.js Buildpack:\r\n  - [nodejs-buildpack v1.6.4](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.6.4)\r\n  - [nodejs-buildpack v1.6.3](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.6.3)\r\n- Python Buildpack:\r\n  - [python-buildpack v1.5.22](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/python-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.5.22)\r\n- PHP Buildpack:\r\n  - [php-buildpack v4.3.38](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/php-buildpack/releases/tag/v4.3.38) (no change)\r\n- Staticfile Buildpack:\r\n  - [staticfile-buildpack v1.4.11](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/staticfile-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.4.11) (no change)\r\n- Binary Buildpack:\r\n  - [binary-buildpack v1.0.13](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/binary-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.0.13) (no change)\r\n- .Net Core Buildpack:\r\n  - [dotnet-core-buildpack v1.0.23](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/dotnet-core-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.0.23)\r\n- Consul:\r\n  - [consul-release v152](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/consul-release/releases/tag/v152) (no change)\r\n- Etcd:\r\n  - [etcd-release v104](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/v104) (no change)\r\n- NATS:\r\n  - [nats-release v20](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nats-release/releases/tag/v20)\r\n  - [nats-release v21](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nats-release/releases/tag/v21)\r\n  - [nats-release v22](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nats-release/releases/tag/v22)\r\n- Postgres:\r\n  - [postgres-release v18](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release/releases/tag/v18)\r\n\r\n## \u003ca name='v269-compatible-releases-and-stemcells'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eCompatible Releases and Stemcells\r\n- Diego release [v1.23.2](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/tree/v1.23.2).
