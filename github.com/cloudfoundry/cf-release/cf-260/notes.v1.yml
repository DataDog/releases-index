The workaround is to set `login.links.homeRedirect: null` in the cf-release manifest\r\n- Known issue with /check_token failing on GET request.\r\n- This release includes breaking changes for OAuth clients thats are defined in the cf-release manifest. Starting with UAA Release [v36](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa-release/releases/tag/v36) we have added validation for OAuth Clients. You can find [the full list here](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/message/Q3BSXMYQHFKTWP2LZDQHVOYO7EXTBF6P/), but below are the changes deployers are most likely to see:\r\n   - For `cf` client please ensure that secret is set to empty string ` '' `\r\n   - For `ssh-proxy` replace `redirect-uri` of /login with `https://login.{system-domain}/login`\r\n \r\n\r\n**Contents**\r\n- \u003ca href='#v260-notices'\u003eNotices\u003c/a\u003e\r\n- \u003ca href='#v260-job-spec-changes'\u003eJob Spec Changes\r\n- \u003ca href='#v260-security-notices'\u003eSecurity Notices\u003c/a\u003e\r\n- \u003ca href='#v260-compatible-releases-and-stemcells'\u003eCompatible Releases and Stemcells\u003c/a\u003e\r\n- \u003ca href='#v260-subcomponent-updates'\u003eSubcomponent Updates\u003c/a\u003e\r\n\r\n## \u003ca name='v260-notices'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Notices\r\n- Starting with this release, CF deployments will use Diego as its default backend.
