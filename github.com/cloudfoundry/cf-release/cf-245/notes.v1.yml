  "Content": "The cf-release v245 was released on October 09, 2016.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\n- This release fixes a critical security vulnerability pertaining to command injection.  Please see the [mailing list thread on CVE 2016-6655](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/thread/42YUJU2N27HBPFVMZR2QM7JI6YSEKORR/) for more details.  Operators are strongly encouraged to update to this latest version of cf-release.\n- This release includes a significant migration of the CCDB that is the first step to releasing the CC V3 API. Please see the [release notes for CAPI v1.6.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.6.0) for details.\n- CVE-2016-6658: The Cloud Controller in CF-245 contains a fix for a medium CVE where apps using custom buildpack urls could contain credentials. This fix ensures that urls containing credentials are either encrypted or stored in an obfuscated format at rest. This is a continuation of CVE-2016-6638 originally reported fixed in CF-241.\n\n**KNOWN ISSUES**\n- The included version of CAPI Release contains an issue staging Python buildpack based apps and apps using any buildpack that doesn't return process types in the staging result. We've prioritized [this bug at the top of our backlog](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/132190561). Workaround is to add a Procfile containing any command, e.g. `web: foo`.\n\n**Contents:**\n- \u003ca href='#cc-and-service-broker-apis'\u003eCC and Service Broker APIs\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#identity'\u003eIdentity\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#routing'\u003eRouting\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#loggregator'\u003eLoggregator\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#buildpacks-and-stacks'\u003eBuildpacks and Stacks\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#dea-warden-hm9000-runtime'\u003eDEA-Warden-HM9000 Runtime\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#internal-components'\u003eInternal Components\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#recommended-versions-additional-releases'\u003eRecommended Versions of Additional Releases\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#job-spec-changes'\u003eJob Spec Changes\u003c/a\u003e\n- \u003ca href='#recommended-bosh-stemcell-versions'\u003eRecommended BOSH Stemcell Versions\u003c/a\u003e\n\n## \u003ca name='cc-and-service-broker-apis'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eCC and Service Broker APIs\n\nContains [CAPI release v1.7.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/tree/1.7.0).
