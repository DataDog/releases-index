regression](http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3087-2/).\n\nUSN-3087-2 is a fix for a regression introduced by USN-3087-1, which was included in [cflinuxfs2 1.83.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stacks/releases/tag/1.83.0).\n\n#### [1.83.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stacks/releases/tag/1.83.0)\n\nNotably, this release addresses [USN-3087-1: OpenSSL vulnerabilities](http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3087-1/) Ubuntu Security Notice USN-3087-1:\n- [CVE-2016-2177](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2177): OpenSSL through 1.0.2h incorrectly uses pointer arithmetic for heap-bufferboundary checks, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial ofservice (integer overflow and application crash) or possibly haveunspecified other impact by leveraging unexpected malloc behavior, relatedto s3_srvr.c, ssl_sess.c, and t1_lib.c.\n- [CVE-2016-2178](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2178): The dsa_sign_setup function in crypto/dsa/dsa_ossl.c in OpenSSL through1.0.2h does not properly ensure the use of constant-time operations, whichmakes it easier for local users to discover a DSA private key via a timingside-channel attack.\n- [CVE-2016-2179](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2179): The DTLS implementation in OpenSSL before 1.1.0 does not properly restrictthe lifetime of queue entries associated with unused out-of-order messages,which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memoryconsumption) by maintaining many crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously,related to d1_lib.c, statem_dtls.c, statem_lib.c, and statem_srvr.c.\n- [CVE-2016-2180](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2180): The TS_OBJ_print_bio function in crypto/ts/ts_lib.c in the X.509 Public KeyInfrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP) implementation in OpenSSL through1.0.2h allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-boundsread and application crash) via a crafted time-stamp file that ismishandled by the \"openssl ts\" command.\n- [CVE-2016-2181](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2181): The Anti-Replay feature in the DTLS implementation in OpenSSL before 1.1.0mishandles early use of a new epoch number in conjunction with a largesequence number, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service(false-positive packet drops) via spoofed DTLS records, related torec_layer_d1.c and ssl3_record.c.\n- [CVE-2016-2182](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2182): The BN_bn2dec function in crypto/bn/bn_print.c in OpenSSL before 1.1.0 doesnot properly validate division results, which allows remote attackers tocause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and application crash) orpossibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.\n- [CVE-2016-2183](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2183): The DES and Triple DES ciphers, as used in the TLS, SSH, and IPSecprotocols and other protocols and products, have a birthday bound ofapproximately four billion blocks, which makes it easier for remoteattackers to obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack against along-duration encrypted session, as demonstrated by an HTTPS session usingTriple DES in CBC mode, aka a \"Sweet32\" attack.\n- [CVE-2016-6302](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6302): The tls_decrypt_ticket function in ssl/t1_lib.c in OpenSSL before 1.1.0does not consider the HMAC size during validation of the ticket length,which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a ticketthat is too short.\n- [CVE-2016-6303](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6303): Integer overflow in the MDC2_Update function in crypto/mdc2/mdc2dgst.c inOpenSSL before 1.1.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service(out-of-bounds write and application crash) or possibly have unspecifiedother impact via unknown vectors.\n- [CVE-2016-6304](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6304): OCSP Status Request extension unbounded memory growth\n- [CVE-2016-6306](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6306): In ssl3_get_client_certificate, ssl3_get_server_certificate andssl3_get_certificate_request check we have enough roombefore reading a length.\n\n#### [1.82.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stacks/releases/tag/1.82.0)\n\nTo address RFC #36, this release upgrades Ruby from 2.2.4 to 2.3.1.\n\nThis release also addresses [USN-3085-1: GDK-PixBuf vulnerabilities](http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3085-1/) Ubuntu Security Notice USN-3085-1:\n- [CVE-2015-7552](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7552): Heap-based buffer overflow in the gdk_pixbuf_flip function in gdk-pixbuf-scale.c in gdk-pixbuf 2.30.x allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted BMP file.\n- [CVE-2015-8875](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8875): Multiple integer overflows in the (1) pixops_composite_nearest, (2)pixops_composite_color_nearest, and (3) pixops_process functions in pixops/pixops.c in gdk-pixbuf before 2.33.1 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted image, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.\n-
