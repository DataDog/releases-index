As such, `router.status.password` (which has been configurable for a long time) is now required.\r\n- cc_uploader now requires the following properties to be configured:\r\n  - `properties.capi.cc_uploader.cc.ca_cert`\r\n  - `properties.capi.cc_uploader.cc.client_cert`\r\n  - `properties.capi.cc_uploader.cc.client_key`\r\n  Diego manifest generation (as of Diego 1.11.0) has already required this property to be configured, so it's likely that most deployers have already set these values. For deployers building their manifests some other way, these properties are now required by the components themselves.\r\n- In the postgres job, the default value for the `databases.monit_timeout` has been changed to 90 seconds.\r\n- The included version of Loggregator restricts ciphers to use only the following 4 ciphers. This is a breaking change for some operators and a configurable property for opting into more cipher suites was introduced in Loggregator 85\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\r\nTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\r\n\r\n## \u003ca name='security-notices'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSecurity Notices\r\n\r\n### Affecting v256\r\nNone recorded as of 2017-04-11.\r\n\r\n### Resolved in v256\r\n- [CVE-2017-4970](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/cve-2017-4970) in Staticfile buildpack versions v1.4.0 â€“ v1.4.3 (high severity)\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n- Users that belong to any space containing a user provided service instance are unable to view any specific service plan: `/v2/service_plans/:guid`.
