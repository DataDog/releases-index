It's not recommended for production, but for those deploying it, here is the information for netman-release:\n- netman release [v0.6.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/netman-release/tree/v0.6.0).\n  Release notes for\n  [v0.6.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/netman-release/releases/tag/v0.6.0).\n\n## \u003ca name='job-spec-changes'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eJob Spec Changes\n- Add `etcd.client_ip` and `etcd.peer_ip` to allow specifying the bind address for the etcd server [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1488988/stories/133885495)\n- Add `etcd_proxy.ip` to allow specifying the bind address the the etcd proxy server [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1488988/stories/133885495)\n\n## \u003ca name='recommended-bosh-stemcell-versions'\u003e\u003c/a\u003eRecommended BOSH Stemcell Versions\n- real IaaS: 3309\n- BOSH-Lite: 3309\n\nNote: For AWS you should use the [Xen-HVM](http://bosh.io/stemcells/bosh-aws-xen-hvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent) stemcells rather than Xen.\n\nThese are soft recommendations; several different versions of the stemcells are likely to work fine with this version of cf-release and the corresponding versions of the additional releases listed above.\n"
