  "Content": "Improvements:\n- [`bosh upload release` should not take a lot longer when uploading large releases vs small releases](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/101726210)\n\nSSH Improvements:\n- [`bosh ssh` no longer asks for a sudo password](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/104387452)\n  - Generated bosh users now have passwordless sudo\n  - To use this feature you need updated CLI (1.3115.0+), the Director (v217/1.3115.0+) and stemcells (3115+)\n- [Director can be configured to provide default ssh gateway for `bosh ssh`](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/104125746)\n  - Instead of adding `--gateway_host` flag for bosh ssh command, specify [`director.default_ssh_options.gateway_host`](https://bosh.io/jobs/director?source=github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh#p=director.default_ssh_options.gateway_host) when deploying the Director\n\nNote: we are still working on a new bosh-lite stemcell to bring above improvements to bosh-lite.\n"
