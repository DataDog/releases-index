  "Content": "New Features:\n- Enabled `auditd` on stemcells to satisfy several STIG requirements\n  - Configured `audisp` syslog plugin to redirect auditd logs to local syslog\n- Hardened variety of OS configurations according to STIGS\n  - See label:\"medium:phase1\" and label:\"stig\" in Tracker for more details\n  - Example: Lock user account after 5 failed login attempts\n- Added [`director.log_access_events_to_syslog`](http://bosh.io/jobs/director?source=github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh#p=director.log_access_events_to_syslog) property (defaults to false) to enable Director to log all access to its API\n  - Confirmed to work with [syslog-release](https://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry/syslog-release?all=1) colocated on the Director VM\n  - Access events are logged in common event format (CEF) under 'vcap.bosh.director' syslog topic\n- Added [`director.events.record_events`](http://bosh.io/jobs/director?source=github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh\u0026version=256#p=director.events.record_events) property to automatically record high level deployment events\n  - Exposed via `bosh events` command\n- Added [`director.flush_arp`](http://bosh.io/jobs/director?source=github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh#p=director.flush_arp) property (defaults to false) to enable aggressive ARP flushing\n  - Especially useful on AWS since AWS disable gratuitous ARP messages\n  - In summary, Director sends `delete_arp_entries` to all the Agents managed by the Director when new VMs come up\n- Switched to using delayed job instead of Resque for managing Director tasks\n  - Warning: make sure to update your Director manifest (used with bosh-init) to remove mentions of redis.\n- Show start and end time for tasks via `bosh tasks`\n- Allow manual link configuration in the deployment manifest\n  - Useful for when link provider is not a job in the Director\n- Include `id`, `name` and `created_at` when making `set_vm_metadata` CPI call\n  - This information should aide discovery of VMs in the IaaS\n\nImprovements:\n- Switched to using s3cli when Director is configured to use S3 blobstore\n  - Agent has been using s3cli to access blobstore, so this change makes behaviour more consistent\n- Add `instance.bootstrap` indicator for instances in a link\n  - Why: when looping through instances included in a link sometimes it's necessary to know first instance\n- Allow job level properties for addons making property namespacing unnecessary\n  - We have upcoming bosh-init change that adds support for this as well\n- Return better YAML error message for invalid manifest, cloud config, and runtime config files\n- Exposed `blobstore.nginx.workers` property to increase number of Nginx workers for local blobstore\n  - Requested by one of the teams with large enough releases/packages that slowed down blobstore access\n- Stopped attempting to recreate VM when vSphere was not able to create disk in a datastore\n- Bumped CentOS 7.x packages\n  - Also include `dev_tools_file_list.txt` in the stemcell tarball to easily identify which files will be removed by the Agent\n- Optimally order the files inside compiled release tarballs when using `bosh export release`\n\nFixes:\n- Possible conflicting SHA1 when finalizing release via `bosh finalize release`\n  - Before this fix, issue was typically resolved by looking up correct SHA1 from .final_builds directory\n- Fixed removal of dev tools on CentOS stemcells\n- Backfill stemcells' `operating_system` field for existing stemcells that do not have it\n  - Necessary for working with compiled packages\n- Ignore snapshot when VM is missing\n\nDev:\n- Added `BOSH_FINAL_RELEASE_VERSION` env var in bosh-dev for Jenkins compatiblity\n- Include grub configuration in warden stemcell to make them more consistent\n- Bumped eventmachine to 1.0.4, sequel (3.43 -\u003e 4.32.0), sqlite3 (1.3.10 -\u003e 1.3.11), datadog_api (1.21)\n\nThis release includes 3232 stemcell series.\n"
