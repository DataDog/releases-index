  "Content": "Features:\n- Introducing `bosh instances --ps` to view process status as reported by monit. To use this feature you need updated CLI (1.3093.0+), the Director (v209/1.3088.0+) and stemcells (3088+). For example:\n\n```\n+---------------------+---------+---------------+-------------+\n| Instance            | State   | Resource Pool | IPs         |\n+---------------------+---------+---------------+-------------+\n| first/0             | running | default       | 10.10.16.12 |\n|   dummy2            | running |               |             |\n|   dummy             | running |               |             |\n+---------------------+---------+---------------+-------------+\n| first_witout_disk/0 | running | old           | 10.10.16.13 |\n|   dummy2            | running |               |             |\n+---------------------+---------+---------------+-------------+\n```\n- [Allow to repair stemcell with `bosh upload stemcell X --fix`](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/103218714)\n  - `bosh upload release X --fix` is coming up soon\n- [Drain script is called for each release job colocated on a VM](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/70697490) [[docs](https://bosh.io/docs/drain.html)]\n\nSSH Improvements:\n- [`bosh ssh` no longer requires --strict_host_key_checking to be specified for the happy path](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/102530088)\n  - CLI retrieves expected host keys and trusts them\n  - To use this feature you need updated CLI (1.3093.0+), the Director (v211/1.3093.0+) and stemcells (3093+)\n- [`bosh ssh` no longer waits for cleaning up SSH artifacts at the end of SSH sessions](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/104137744)\n\nFixes:\n- [Avoid establishing many connections to the Director from the CLI](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/104469472)\n"
