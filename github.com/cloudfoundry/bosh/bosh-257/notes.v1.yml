  "Content": "Known Issues:\r\n- `spec.networks.send(...)` calls in ERB templates do not work due to Ruby 2.3 changes. Expect v257.1 with the fix shortly.\r\n\r\nNew Features:\r\n- Track Director task permissions separately from deployment permissions\r\n  - Allows users to view tasks for deleted deployments if authorized\r\n- Support `version.latest` (e.g. 3232.latest) version scheme for releases and stemcells\r\n- Added `bosh delete vm \u003cvm-cid\u003e` command to easily delete VMs from the IaaS and the Director\r\n  - Mostly used during recovery and debugging\r\n  - CPI can delete VMs even not managed by the Director\r\n- Added `director.enable_dedicated_status_worker` property (default false) to reserve one workers for just `bosh vms` and `bosh ssh` tasks\r\n- Added `--max-in-flight` and `--canaries` flags for `bosh start/stop/restart/recreate` commands\r\n  - These overrides take precedence over the manifest configuration\r\n  - Mostly used during recovery and debugging\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n- Enable v1 and v2 manifests on same Director\r\n  - If manifest specifies `networks` key the Director will not use cloud config for that deployment\r\n- Events can be filtered by time via `--before` and `--after` flags\r\n- Keep track of exported compiled releases and clean them up via `bosh cleanup` command\r\n- Fix `bosh restore` command to remove tables that dont exists in the restored backup\r\n- Removed 128MB limit from /tmp in stemcells\r\n  - /tmp is still mounted to the ephemeral disk\r\n  - nodev, nosuid, noexec options are now set for /tmp\r\n- Director now automatically reserves its own IP so that it's no longer necessary to place it in the reserved range\r\n- Completed variety of CIS hardening stories for the stemcell\r\n- Raise meaningful error if non-existent vm_extension is requested\r\n- Keep track of resurrection status globally when it's set via `bosh vm resurrection off` command\r\n  - When temporarily turned off no new resurrection tasks will be enqueued\r\n- Make sure none of the IPv6 configurations are enabled in stemcells\r\n- Removed rpcbind package on CentOS stemcells\r\n- Small cosmetic adjustments to the deployment diff\r\n- Set an upper limit to the watch_schedule wait times\r\n\r\nVersion bumps:\r\n- Updated Director \u0026 Blobstore nginx to 1.11.1\r\n- Updated Postrges to 9.4.8\r\n- Updated s3cli with S3 server side encryption configurations\r\n\r\nDev:\r\n- Bumped bundler\r\n- Switch to using JSON instead of Yajl for stricter JSON validations\r\n\r\nThis release includes 3262 stemcell series.\r\n"
