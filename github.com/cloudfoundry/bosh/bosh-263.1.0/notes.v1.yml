  "Content": "- Sort property/link property before rendering templates\r\n- Errand should be able to consume link with variables from a diff deployment\r\n- [warning] Remove transaction around `bosh deploy --dry-run` command\r\n  - Previously dry run was wrapped in a DB transaction; however, it caused DB contention, hence transaction was removed. After this change if you run `--dry-run` against an existing deployment we recommend to run bosh deploy with previously successfully deployed manifest."
