  "Content": "_Reported problems_:\n- Earlier versions of the Director erroneously applied instance group properties to addons. Addons only should see properties specified in runtime config. This v258 no longer exhibits old behaviour.\n- HM started to query `/deployments/:name/instances` API which sometimes causes high CPU usage in the Director since it performs large number of queries\n  - One workaround until this problem is fixed is to re-run `bosh deploy` on your existing deployments\n\nNew Features:\n- Added `--dry-run` flag to bosh deploy that exits right before starting an actual deploy\n  - Useful to validate that deployment manifest, releases, and stemcells are all correct\n- Added ability to tag VMs with arbitrary tags within a deployment via top level `tags` key\n- [beta] Support multiple persistent disks for each instance within an instance group\n  - Persistent disks are considered unmanaged by the Agent so release jobs have to partition and format them\n- Added experimental `--fix` flag to `bosh deploy` to automatically recreate VMs that are not responsive\n- Added `spec.ip` for ERB templates for jobs to get their own IP\n  - Operator can set networks to be `addressable` via `default` key to change which IP jobs see\n- Add support for OS-specific addons\n  - Director allows to specify where addons are included based on deployment, OS and instance group names\n\nImprovements:\n- Write Director events to syslog in addition to recording them into DB\n  - Works great with `cloudfoundry/syslog-release`\n- Send `env.bosh.group` and `env.bosh.groups` to CPIs for automatic tagging, etc.\n  - Used primarily for automatic creation of Azure availability sets and GCP security groups\n- Switched to using `davcli` in the Director to make blobstore access consistent with the Agents\n- Fixed HM Resurrector to bring back VMs that were successfully deleted but failed to be recreated\n  - Switched HM to use `/deployments/:name/instances` endpoint\n- Avoid `env.bosh.remove_dev_tools` flag causing VM recreate\n- Allow Director to handle badly encoded UTF-8 data in CPI responses\n- Support percentages in canaries and max in flight update configurations\n- Fix addon properties handling when single addon references multiple jobs\n- `bosh cck` no longer shows empty VM cids in problem it reports\n- Avoid stopping / taking snapshots of stopped instances\n- Task can be cancelled when Director is waiting for the VM to be in specific state\n- Switched showing release version in `bosh status`\n\nVersion bumps:\n- Bump `s3cli` in the Director to latest\n  - Adds support for server side encryption for S3\n  - GCS support\n\nMisc:\n- Continued working on config server support\n- Continued working on bosh CLI v2 integration test suite\n"
