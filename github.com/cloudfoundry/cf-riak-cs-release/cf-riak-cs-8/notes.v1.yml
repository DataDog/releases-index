  "Content": "### Highlights\n- Timeout for [acceptance tests](/cf-riak-cs-release#running-acceptance-tests) is configurable for BOSH errand using manifest property `timeout_scale`, and when running tests manually with a property in integration_config.json. Increasing the timeout assists with debugging test failures. `timeout_scale` defaults to 1.0; a value of 2.0 doubles the timeout.\n- Acceptance tests are now run in parallel, which significantly speeds up test runs.\n- Improved acceptance test output on failure\n\n### Manifest Changes\n- Job: acceptance_tests - `properties.timeout_scale` (optional, defaults to 1.0)\n"
