  "Content": "## Core Enhancements\n- Properly handle secure redirection from insecure endpoints.  If\n  you target a SHIELD over a non-HTTPS endpoint, the CLI will wait\n  to see if it gets redirected to an HTTPS endpoint before sending\n  any credentials.  Fixes shield/#151.\n- Authentication now produces more helpful debugging and\n  diagnostic information, to assist site operators in\n  troubleshooting their auth setup.\n- Users can now be granted access to SHIELD based on UAA\n  credentials and their role assignments / memberships.\n\n## Bug Fixes\n- Fix a bug in the timespec scheduling logic for weekly jobs that\n  would cause 60 separate tasks (one per second) to fire off when\n  the weekly backup was to be run.\n- Rename `nginx.ssl_cert` property to `nginx.ssl_crt`, so that\n  custom certificates will work with SHIELD.\n- Fix an off-by-one bug in the Web UI that was causing dates in\n  May to display as dates in April (for example).\n\n## S3 Plugin Enhancements\n- The `s3_host` configuration option is now optional, and defaults\n  to using Amazon's `s3.amazonaws.com` endpoint.\n- The `prefix` configuration option is now optional, allowing\n  backups to be placed directly in the root \n- The `skip_ssl_validation` configuration option now defaults to\n  false (i.e., actually verify certs received from S3)\n- The `socks5_proxy` configuration option now displays in\n  validation output.\n\n## Postgres Plugin Enhancements\n- Now supports backing up a single database on a cluster, via the\n  `pg_database` configuration option.\n"
