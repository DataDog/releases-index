  "Content": "# Improvements\n- Revamped SSH key support for agent/daemon communication.\n  The SSH key is now required to be input, rather than having\n  a key tied to stemcells + upgrades. Made property names more\n  relevant for ssh key related properties.\n\n# Job Property Renames/Removals\n- The `shield.daemon.host_key` property is no longer used. It has\n  been replaced by `shield.daemon.ssh_private_key`, with no default\n  value. This _must_ be specified in your manifest\n- The `shield.agent.authorized_keys` property is no longer used. It\n  has been replaced by `shield.agent.daemon_public_key`. The new value\n  is a scalar of the public key corresponding to `shield.daemon.ssh_private_key`,\n  whereas the old property was an array. The agent will continue to use this\n  in conjunction with any key found via the `shield.agent.autoprovision`\n  detection.\n- The `shield.agent.authorize_generated_daemon_key` has been removed. It is no longer\n  necessary, since the daemon key is no longer generated behind the scenes.\n\n# shield\n\nBumped https://github.com/starkandwayne/shield to v0.6.4\n"
