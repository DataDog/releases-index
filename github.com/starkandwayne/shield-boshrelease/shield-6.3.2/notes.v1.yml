Use the configuration\n  option `database_type` to set the database driver to `mysql`.\n\n# Bug Fixes\n- Add a timeout of 20 seconds to the curl call that retrieves the\n  public key from the SHIELD core, to avoid deadlock conditions\n  that arise when the start script cannot access the core, either\n  due to networking issues, naming problems, or firewall / ACLs.\n- Fixes a bug where `shield list jobs --paused/--unpaused` is reversed.\n"
