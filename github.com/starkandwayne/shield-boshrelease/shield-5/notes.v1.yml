  "Content": "# New Features\n- Added a new Web UI for SHIELD to manipulate configs, schedule and run tasks, as well as see\n  what's going on in SHIELD.\n- Added a new **validation mode** for plugins, so they can validate their endpoint configuration\n  prior to running the job, and during configuration updates.\n- Added a new `/v1/status/internal` API to `shield-daemon` to provide better visibility into the\n  internals of the `shieldd` daemon\n- Added a **recovery mode** to `shield-agent`, for emergency restoration. This is mostly focused\n  at allowing one to restore BOSH or SHIELD from a backup, prior to having `shield-daemon` up and\n  running, after a disaster. For details, see\n  [our Disaster Recovery wiki page](https://github.com/starkandwayne/shield/wiki/Recovering-from-a-Disaster-Using-SHIELD).\n- Upon restart of `shield-daemon`, any `pending` tasks are re-scheduled, for cases where `shield-daemon`\n  is restarted in the middle of scheduling a task to run.\n\n# Improvements\n- `shield restore archive` prompts you for targets, rather than jobs, and properly filters\n  the archive list to the target you specified. This makes it easier to restore an archive\n  for a specific service, even if you have multiple jobs (hourly, daily, weekly, etc) for it.\n- The `fs` plugin now implements `store` functionality, and can be used as both target and store,\n  to save local backups on the `shield-agent` machine.\n- Added a lot of default settings for JSON endpoint configurations to make configuration all the\n  easier.\n- Refactored a lot of logic that used to live in-memory of the `shield-daemon` into the database,\n  paving the way for many planned improvements to the daily operation of SHIELD.\n- Made `shield.agent.autoprovision` an optional property, and set it to ignore failures on\n  auto-provisioning, so that one can deploy a `shield-agent` before the IP of the `shield-daemon` is\n  known. This will be followed up on with #15 for a long-term solution:\n\n# Bug Fixes\n- Fixed an issue where `shield-daemon` was keeping connections to `shield-agents` open after\n  completing tasks, exhausting available file descriptors for the daemon\n- Fixed an issue where tasks were incorrectly being marked as `canceled` after their timeout\n  window expired, even if they had completed (successfully or failed)\n- Fixes an issue where weekly backups could send SHIELD into a loop of job re-execution.\n"
