  "Content": "## New Features\n- **Recursive Resolution** - A BIND9 cluster (master + slaves) can\n  now be configured to recursively forward requests for RRs it\n  is not authoritative for, to one or more upstream name servers.\n  By default, this behavior is off.  Thanks @geofffranks!\n- **Configuration / Zone Checks** - Before `named` is started\n  (either on the master or slave jobs), a full configuration\n  check, including the zone database files on `master` is\n  performed.  If any problems are found (usually bad zone files),\n  the job is terminated and marked as failing, so that the cluster\n  can remain healthy and BOSH will halt the deployment.\n"
