  "Content": "## Bug Fixes\n- The ~/.repo file is no longer constantly updated by the `watcher`\n  script. It is only updated when the contents change. This works\n  around issues when performing tar-based-backups that take longer\n  than 5 minutes, as the watcher script would update the modification/\n  creation time of files underneath tar, causing it to error.\n\n##### cf\n\nBumped cf to v6.25.0\n\n##### vim\n\nUpdated vim to v8.0.0386\n"
