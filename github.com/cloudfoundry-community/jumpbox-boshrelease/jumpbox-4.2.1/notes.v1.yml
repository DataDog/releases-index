  "Content": "## Improvements\n- User home directories are now in /u/$name, so that `bosh-init`\n  doesn't fail to deploy things like ruby-based CPIs that rely on\n  gem + bundler.  It's not LSB, but it's ok\n- SSH Host Keys will now persist across VM recreation, so you can\n  start trusting your SSH Host Key mismatch warnings again, and\n  maybe even re-enable strict host key checking!\n- Some UNIX trickery was added to ensure that UID/GIDs stayed the\n  same across BOSH recreates and VM resurrection, so that people\n  don't lose ownership to files outside their home directories due\n  to UID/GID re-assignment.\n- One-time per-user setup is now no longer triggered for the\n  `vcap` user, or for any of the temporary accounts created for\n  `bosh ssh` sessions.\n\n## Bug Fixes\n- Handle utilities that don't send their version information to\n  standard output, like `safe`.  Redirecting stderr makes the\n  output of the errand look muuuuuuch nicer.\n"
