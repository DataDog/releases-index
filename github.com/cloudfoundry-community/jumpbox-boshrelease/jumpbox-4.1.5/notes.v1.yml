  "Content": "## New Features\n- Provisioning should work better now, since there is a daemon\n  process watching the box and \"patching things up\"\n- Accounts that were built by previous jumpbox manifests, but are\n  not currently in the manifest, will be disabled, and their home\n  directories renamed.  This allows administrators to manage\n  account lifecycles more easily.\n- A new `jumpbox.delete` property allows accounts to be deleted\n  from the jumpbox, but only those that had been provisioned by\n  the manifest.\n\n##### spruce\n\nBumped spruce to v1.8.2\n\n##### safe\n\nBumped safe to v0.0.26\n\n##### cf\n\nBumped cf to v6.22.2\n"
