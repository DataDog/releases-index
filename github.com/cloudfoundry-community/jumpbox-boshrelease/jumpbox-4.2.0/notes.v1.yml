  "Content": "## New Features\n- Per-user setup is now handled on a per-user basis, via a\n  one-time setup script embedded in their ~/.bashrc / ~/.zshrc\n  profiles.  This should greatly speed up provisioning.\n- You can now set the jumpbox login banner, via `jumpbox.banner`\n  It's got a spiffy default too!\n\n## Improvements\n- Default `$PATH` now puts the jumpbox package bin directory\n  first, so that release-provided software like `curl` and `vim`\n  takes precedence over system versions.\n- New sane default configuration for `vim` and `tmux`\n- New `acceptance-tests` job for verifying the viability of the\n  Jumpbox BOSH release itself.  This will be used in our CI\n  pipelines moving forward, to ensure that all utilities work\n  out of the box.\n\n##### safe\n\nBumped safe to v0.0.27\n\n##### cf\n\nBumped cf to v6.22.2\n"
