  "Content": "# BOSH Release for cf-haproxy\n\nThis BOSH release is an attempt to get a more customizable/secure haproxy release than what is provided in [cf-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release).\n\nIt adds the following features:\n- blacklisting internal-only domains, to prevent Host header spoofing\n- fine-graned timeout configurations for http, https, and websocket connections\n- no tcp-mode proxying, just HTTP proxying, to prevent backdoors around Host header spoofing.\n"
