  "Content": "# New Features\n- Supports multiple ssl certs on haproxy nodes. Specify them by using `ha_proxy.ssl_pem` as an array of certs, and the boshrelease will install all of them, and make them available to haproxy, in the event that you are serving multiple domains up via https, with different certs for each.\n- Supports force-setting headers. If there are headers you need to enforce on your requests for some reason, you can now use `ha_proxy.headers` to configure the headers and values. \n- Supports generic TCP proxying via the `ha_proxy.tcp` array. Each element in the array defines a port to enable tcp-mode proxying on. Supposts TLS + TCP proxying as well\n"
