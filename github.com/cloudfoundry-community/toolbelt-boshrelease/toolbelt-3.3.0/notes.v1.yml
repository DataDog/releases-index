  "Content": "## New Features\n\nToolbelt now includes [gotcha](https://github.com/starkandwayne/gotcha) for all your HTTP proxying\nand diagnostic needs!  Because it is a MiTM proxy, it's in a\ndifferent job (`toolbelt-dev`) all by itself.  Other tools you may\nnot want to run in production will also go in there, as time goes\non.\n\nThe `toolbelt/errands` job can now be used to build run multiple\nother errand tasks, either in parallel or serially, within a\nsingle errand job.  This lets you bundle lots of test errands\ntogether, for example, and not have to deal with BOSH locking when\nyou want to run them all at once.\n\nUsing it is as easy as:\n\n```\njobs:\n  - name: test-all-the-things\n    templates:\n      - { release: toolbelt, name: errands }\n      - { release: other,    name: smoke-tests }\n      - { release: other,    name: acceptance-tests }\n      - { release: other,    name: network-tests }\n    # other necessary job config\n```\n\nThe new `toolbelt.errands.*` properties govern how this behaves.\n"
