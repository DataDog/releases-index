  "Content": "# Link Support\n\n- The `haproxy` job now supports consuming links for backends.\n  You can provide it the `http_backend` link, to control the default\n  http/https backend. You can also give it an additional `tcp_backend`\n  link to add in a tcp-backend that uses links. If your link doesn't\n  support providing the `port` property, the job fails back to `ha_proxy.tcp_link_port`\n  and `ha_proxy.backend_port`, depending on which link is in play.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nMany thanks to @rkoster for bringing link support to `haproxy-boshrelease`!"
