  "Content": "# Bug Fixes\n\n- Resolved an issue where certs specified using the new `cert_chain`\n  and `private_key` would result in an invalid cert file, if a newline\n  wasn't provided in the `cert_chain` value. Leading + trailing whitespace\n  are now removed, and the newline is added for you.\n- When using links for the TCP backend, the `health_check_http` property is now consumed, to\n  set up an HTTP health check for the backend. If not there, it will fail\n  to the default `ha_proxy.tcp_link_health_check_http` value (or if that\n  isn't present, no health check is enabled)\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nThanks @ryanmoran and @philippthun for the fixes!\n\n### Deployment\n```yaml\nreleases:\n- name: haproxy\n  version: 8.4.1\n  url: https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/haproxy-boshrelease/releases/download/v8.4.1/haproxy-8.4.1.tgz\n  sha1: 3b860b9a12ac94ea9e9f9f6ad7ec7b58becd0e7a\n```"
