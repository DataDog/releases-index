  "Content": "CF networking policies now support port ranges in addition to a single port in policy configuration. In addition, the silk controller provides a link for the silk daemon to configure the overlay network for cf-networking. \r\n\r\nTry it out and give us your feedback in the [#container-networking](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/container-networking/details/) channel on cloudfoundry.slack.com. \r\n\r\nTake a look at [known issues](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-networking-release/blob/develop/docs/known-issues.md) for current limitations and known issues. Verified with the following:\r\n- [CF deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/616390616063f58301000eeaf903afcffd8135b4/cf-deployment.yml#L1626)\r\n\r\n## Manifest Changes\r\n**Links Enabled**\r\nThe `silk-controller` job now provides two properties via links which the `silk-daemon` job consumes:\r\n\r\n- `cf_networking.network`\r\n- `cf_networking.subnet_prefix_length`\r\n** This means you are able to remove the properties (listed above) from the `silk-daemon` job. **\r\n\r\nIf your deployment contains more than a single instance group that has the `silk-controller` job,\r\nthen you will need to explicitly name the `cf_network` link. For more information,\r\n[see the documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/links.html#deployment).\r\n\r\n**New Properties**\r\n  - An optional parameter has been added to configure the port of the metron agent for\r\n    the iptables_logger. This port will be used to forward metrics. Previously, no such\r\n    port existed.\r\n    - `cf_networking.iptables_logger.metron_port`\r\n\r\n## Significant Changes\r\n\r\n### Port Ranges\r\n\r\n- [As an operator I would like to specify a range of ports in policy configuration APIs](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/134604191)\r\n- [As an operator I would like to specify a range of ports in policy configuration CLI](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/140096457)\r\n- [As an operator I would like to see a range of ports in policy configuration CLI](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/149855856)\r\n- [As an operator I would like to remove access for a range of ports in policy configuration CLI](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/149855876)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Optimizations\r\n\r\n- [Operators can configure a single property to change the overlay network](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/144416939)\r\n- [policy-server and silk-controller work with MySQL 5.6](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/148173239)\r\n- [Operators should see info on resource consumption of log forwarder in github](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/148802413)\r\n\r\n### Logging Enhancemetns\r\n\r\n- [Iptables-logger logs a metric for uptime](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/149696323)\r\n- [fix flaky iptables logger tests](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/149860647)\r\n- [iptables logger is running in a cf-release deployment](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/149891379)\r\n\r\n### Chores\r\n\r\n- [allow running ifb tests on a dev workstation](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/149898305)\r\n- [Fix issue with unbound running security groups on mitre](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/149976886)\r\n- [Rename GetRoutableLeases to GetActiveLeases](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/147273651)\r\n- [Policy-server wrappers use http.Request.Context for passing values](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/149572867)\r\n"
