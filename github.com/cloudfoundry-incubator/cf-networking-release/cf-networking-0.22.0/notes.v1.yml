  "Content": "This release introduces a beta version of a new container networking fabric called \"[silk](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/silk)\" and contains significant changes to job and property names. In order to deploy silk you must upgrade to Diego release [v1.15.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v1.15.0) or higher.\r\n\r\n[Silk](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/silk) is a replacement for flannel, which uses a central controller node backed by a SQL database. Etcd is no longer required by CF Networking Release when running Silk.\r\n\r\nThere are several manifest changes required to enable Silk, and we highly recommend reading the [manifest changelog](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-networking-release/blob/develop/docs/manifest-changelog.md) to understand the changes. \r\n\r\nWe do not recommend using cf-networking-release in production yet, but give it a try and give us your feedback in the [#container-networking](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/container-networking/details/) channel on cloudfoundry.slack.com. \r\n\r\nTake a look at [known issues](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-networking-release/blob/develop/docs/known-issues.md) for current limitations and known issues.
