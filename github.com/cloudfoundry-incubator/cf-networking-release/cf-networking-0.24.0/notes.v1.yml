  "Content": "This release allows operators to configure the UDP port used for the VXLAN devices and makes it possible to change the IP address range allocated for the container network.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it adds further improvements to the control scripts for all BOSH jobs and introduces basic uptime monitoring for the `silk-daemon`.\r\n\r\nWe do not recommend using cf-networking-release in production yet, but give it a try and give us your feedback in the [#container-networking](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/container-networking/details/) channel on cloudfoundry.slack.com. \r\n\r\nTake a look at [known issues](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-networking-release/blob/develop/docs/known-issues.md) for current limitations and known issues. Verified with the following:\r\n- [CF deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/tree/171fede2351726a520286ab89986946da100be2a)\r\n\r\n## Manifest Changes\r\n\r\n### New Properties\r\n\r\n- The host port for receiving VXLAN packets is now configurable as `cf_networking.vtep_port` for flannel and silk. Overriding this value is optional.\r\n\r\n## Significant Changes\r\n\r\n### BOSH configuration\r\n\r\n- [As an operator I can change the overlay network mask to enlarge the network](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/144881385)\r\n- [CF networking jobs use links for database configuration](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/145088179)\r\n- [An operator can override the UDP port used for VXLAN traffic](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/145243353)\r\n\r\n### BOSH job control scripts\r\n\r\n- [All control scripts are using a common pid_utils](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/144596281)\r\n- [Fix monit issues with silk-daemon](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/145063947)\r\n\r\n### Silk metrics\r\n\r\n- [silk-daemon emits an uptime metric](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/144495443)\r\n\r\n### Other\r\n\r\n- [Explore using context in policy server](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143617573)\r\n- [Smoke tests continue to pass during deploys](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/144498245)\r\n\r\n\r\n"
