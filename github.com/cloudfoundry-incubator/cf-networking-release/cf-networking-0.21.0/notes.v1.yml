  "Content": "Fixes compatibility issues with BOSH stemcell version **3363.19**. If you are deploying cf-networking-release you **must upgrade** to this release or a subsequent release to use this and future stemcells. \r\n\r\nWe do not recommend using cf-networking-release in production yet, but give it a try and give us your feedback in the [#container-networking](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/container-networking/details/) channel on cloudfoundry.slack.com. \r\n\r\nTake a look at [known issues](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-networking-release/blob/develop/docs/known-issues.md) for current limitations and known issues.
