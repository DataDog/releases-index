  "Content": "Lots of good stuff in this release. Highlights include:\r\n-  Logging for c2c iptables can be enabled through a BOSH property\r\n- Container networking scales to 20K application instances with 3 policies per application. \r\n- Initial support for logging ASG iptables through a BOSH property. ASG logs will be prefixed with `OK_` or `DENY_`.\r\n- If you are running Diego release [v1.10.1]( https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v1.10.1) you must upgrade to this release\r\n\r\nWe do not recommend using cf-networking-release in production yet, but give it a try and give us your feedback in the [#container-networking](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/container-networking/details/) channel on cloudfoundry.slack.com. \r\n\r\nTake a look at [known issues](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-networking-release/blob/develop/docs/known-issues.md) for current limitations and known issues.\r\n\r\nVerified with the following:\r\n- [CF deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/bfa7cc261ac492924c4c6773b3dcfaf8bf2ab74c/cf-deployment.yml#L1400)\r\n\r\n**New Manifest Properties**\r\n\r\n  - `cf_networking.rep_listen_addr_admin` enables our drain scripts to wait for the Diego rep to exit.\r\n  It should always be the same value as `diego.rep.listen_addr_admin`. It defaults to `127.0.0.1:1800`.\r\n  - `cf_networking.garden_external_networker.iptables_asg_logging` globally enables iptables logging for\r\n    all ASGs, including logging of denied packets. Defaults to false.\r\n  - `cf_networking.vxlan_policy_agent.iptables_c2c_logging` enables iptables logging for\r\n  container-to-container traffic.  It defaults to `false`. *Note: this is already\r\n  [configurable at runtime](troubleshooting.md#enabling-iptables-logging-for-container-to-container-traffic).*\r\n  - `cf_networking.plugin.health_check_port` allows BOSH to better health-check the `flanneld` process\r\n  required for connectivity.\r\n\r\n**Removed Manifest Properties**\r\n\r\n - `cf_networking.policy_server.database.connection_string` was deprecated in v0.10.0 and is now removed.\r\n\r\n## Significant Changes\r\n\r\n### Scalability\r\n- [container networking is reliable with 20k app instances across 100 diego cells](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126714195)\r\n- [Scalability test for popular server](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/128819469)\r\n- [Our docs include recommendations on scaling policy server instances and DB](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/138441411)\r\n- [The policy server can handle our scalability target of 20K AIs](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/140352859)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Upgrades\r\n- [As an operator I can upgrade from kawasaki to cf-networking](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/139329191)\r\n\r\n### Manifest Changes\r\n- [Remove deprecated BOSH property policy_server.database.connection_string](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/139519703)\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n- [Policy server can communicate with UAA over TLS](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/140102631)\r\n\r\n### Chores\r\n- [Investigate and fix \"Ginkgo timed out waiting for parallel nodes to report back\"](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/140152835)\r\n- [Improve stop behavior of monit ctl scripts ](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/140428183)\r\n\r\n### Stability\r\n- [Flannel has a healthcheck endpoint for monit](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/140436089)\r\n- [A cell with a subnet mismatch can be recovered by a BOSH restart of the cell](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/140810927)\r\n- [Policy server monit script checks a healthcheck endpoint](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/140863337)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Logging\r\n- [Logging for c2c iptables is configurable through a BOSH property](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/140438917)\r\n- [Logging for denied outbound non-c2c packets](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/140439535) \r\n\r\n### Internal integration\r\n- [Garden External Networker handles NetIn/NetOut fields during Up](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/140941873)\r\n"
