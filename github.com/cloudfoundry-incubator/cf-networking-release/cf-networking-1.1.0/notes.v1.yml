  "Content": "This release adds the ability for operators to configure their deployment to enable self-service app to app policy creation for all space developers.  \r\n\r\nWhen enabled, `network.write` does not need to be explicitly granted to individual space developers in order for them to be able to create policies between apps in spaces for which they have the SpaceDeveloper role.\r\n\r\nSpace developers now have a configurable quota for the maximum number of policies they can create for any given app as a source.  The quota defaults to 50 but does not apply to users with `network.admin`.\r\n\r\nGive us your feedback in the [#container-networking](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/container-networking/details/) channel on cloudfoundry.slack.com. Take a look at [known issues](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-networking-release/blob/develop/docs/known-issues.md) for current limitations and known issues.\r\n\r\nVerified with the following:\r\n- [CF deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/43ab432c81b38e4068da4cabeb34b381f452ea6a/cf-deployment.yml#L1508)\r\n\r\n## Manifest Changes\r\n \r\n**New Properties**\r\n\r\n- An optional parameter has been added to allow all space developers to create policies (default `false`).\r\n    If this property is not set, a space developer must have `network.write` to create policies.\r\n    - `cf_networking.enable_space_developer_self_service`\r\n- An optional parameter has benn added to configure the maximum number of policies a space\r\n    developer can write for a given source app. Defaults to 50 if it is not set. Does not apply to\r\n    users with `network.admin`:\r\n    - `cf_networking.max_policies_per_app_source`\r\n\r\n## Significant Changes\r\n\r\n### Space Developer Self-Service \r\n\r\n- [An operator can configure the max policies/app at deploy time](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/144539493)\r\n- [As an operator I can enable self service for all space developers](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/146178827)\r\n\r\n### Logging\r\n\r\n- [As an operator, I can grep through my logs to find all the CF Networking stuff](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143081757)\r\n\r\n### Windows Compatibility\r\n\r\n- [garden-external-networker works on Windows](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/146772321)\r\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-networking-release #9: Allow garden-external-networker to be used on windows](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/146813551)"
