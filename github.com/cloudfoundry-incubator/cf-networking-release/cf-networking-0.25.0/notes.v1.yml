  "Content": "Primary changes include stability related fixes and changes to policy enforcement to make container networking policy independent of ASG configuration. \r\n\r\nWe also tested and [documented](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-networking-release/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#diagnosing-and-recovering-from-subnet-overlap) how to detect problems with overlapping overlay network and underlay network ranges.\r\n\r\nWe do not recommend using cf-networking-release in production yet, but give it a try and give us your feedback in the [#container-networking](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/container-networking/details/) channel on cloudfoundry.slack.com. Take a look at [known issues](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-networking-release/blob/develop/docs/known-issues.md) for current limitations and known issues.\r\n\r\nVerified with the following:\r\n- [CF deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/b4da5755c0c5d7e861feca0885b717f591cc9ae8/cf-deployment.yml#L1530)\r\n\r\n## Manifest Changes\r\n### New Properties\r\n\r\nThe optional parameter `cf_networking.lease_poll_interval_seconds` has been added to allow operators to override the default polling interval between silk-daemon and silk-controller.\r\n\r\n### Changed Properties\r\n\r\nThe value for `cf_networking.garden_external_networker.cni_config_dir` now defaults to /var/vcap/jobs/silk-cni/config/cni We recommend that you remove any overrides for this property, unless you are intending to use a 3rd party CNI plugin.\r\n\r\n### Other Changes\r\n\r\nSince silk is now deployed by default, there is no more silk.yml ops file. Deploying with flannel is no longer supported.\r\n\r\n## Significant Changes\r\n\r\n### iptables\r\n- [cf-networking smoke tests and acceptance tests pass on systems configured with a wide open ASG](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/145484059)\r\n\r\n### Stability\r\n- [vxlan-policy-agent fails when policy server is not reachable on start-up](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143753749)\r\n- [Validate behavior when the overlay network configuration overlaps with the underlay IP range](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/145235257)\r\n\r\n### BOSH Links\r\n- [Use bosh links for databases in ops files](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/145320293)\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n- [Get toque passing with 100 proxy apps using GCP concourse workers](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/145382477)\r\n- [Standardize naming convention for repos and stuff](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/145468531)\r\n- [CF networking ops file should install silk](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/145777061)"
