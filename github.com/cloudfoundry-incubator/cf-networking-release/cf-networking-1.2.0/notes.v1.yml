  "Content": "CF networking is officially part of cf-deployment! You do not need a separate ops-file to include cf-networking in your deployment. This release also adds new capabilities for bandwidth limiting and logging enhancements for ASGs and container networking. \r\n\r\nTry it out and give us your feedback in the [#container-networking](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/container-networking/details/) channel on cloudfoundry.slack.com. \r\n\r\nTake a look at [known issues](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-networking-release/blob/develop/docs/known-issues.md) for current limitations and known issues.\r\n\r\nVerified with the following:\r\n- [CF deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/4cff3379b9f5de4e528530b7c88b9b4d34ef874c/cf-deployment.yml#L1632)\r\n\r\n## Manifest Changes\r\n\r\n**New Properties**\r\n\r\n  - Optional parameters have been added to the `silk-cni` job to limit the\r\n    bandwidth in and out of containers.\r\n    - `cf_networking.rate` is the rate in Kbps at which traffic can leave and\r\n      enter a container.\r\n    - `cf_networking.burst` is the burst in Kb at which traffic can leave and\r\n      enter a container.\r\n    - Both of these parameters must be set in order to limit bandwidth. If\r\n      neither one is set, then bandwidth is not limited.\r\n    - The burst must high enough to support the given rate. If burst is not\r\n      high enough, then creating containers will fail.\r\n  - An optional parameter has been added to configure the rate of logs by\r\n    iptables for denied packets. Before, this rate was hardcoded to 2 packets\r\n    per minute. Now, the rate defaults to 1 packet per second.\r\n    - `cf_networking.iptables_denied_logs_per_sec` is the maximum number of\r\n      denied packets logged by iptables per second, it should be configured on\r\n      the `silk-cni` job.\r\n\r\n## Significant Changes\r\n\r\n### Port Ranges\r\n- [External APIs are ready for supporting port ranges](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/140360465)\r\n\r\n### Logging\r\n- [c2c logs for accepted packets use conntrack](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/141828331)\r\n- [An operator can change the sampling time of deny logging](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/141828381)\r\n- [ASG logging works for accepted traffic that match UDP and ICMP whitelist rules](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/142629505)\r\n\r\n### Bandwidth Limiting\r\n- [Operators can configure bandwidth limits for apps](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/145244693)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Deployment Changes\r\n- [cf-networking is in cf-deployment ](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/146391525)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [As an operator I know the options to enable self-service ](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/146963381)\r\n- [Update docs based on boxes \u0026 lines](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/147067063)\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n- [cf list-access fails for non-admin users when there are policies for more than 50 unique apps](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/148254399)\r\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-networking-release #8: Make add route work for Linux](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/146802153)\r\n- [CF CLI plugin version number matches release version](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/147356241)\r\n"
