  "Content": "**Changes**:\n- `etcd_metrics_server` job now supports working with a secure TLS etcd cluster.  Added `etcd_metrics_server.etcd.dns_suffix` property to `etcd_metrics_server` job to support configuring the job to talk to the secure `etcd` server. [details](https://pivotaltracker.com/story/show/121468207).\n- Fix `scripts/generate-certs` to use the more commonly used `.cf.internal` domain suffix, rather than the previous `.consul` suffix. [details](https://pivotaltracker.com/story/show/121897377).\n- Other non-functional changes.\n"
