  "Content": "**Important**:\n\nThis is a **pre-release** and will cause problems for anyone using it in non-SSL mode (`require_ssl: false`), unless they supply a value for the `etcd.advertise_urls_dns_suffix` which does not have any meaning in a non-SSL context.\n\n**Changes**:\n\nThis release removes the default value `etcd.service.cf.internal` from the `etcd.advertise_urls_dns_suffix` property in the `etcd` job.  This removes some coupling with Consul as the service discovery mechanism, and from Cloud Foundry as there are other consumers of this as an independent release.\n"
