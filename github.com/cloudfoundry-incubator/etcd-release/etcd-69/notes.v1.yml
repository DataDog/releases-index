  "Content": "**Changes**:\n- `etcd` job in this release has scripts which drive the `etcdctl` binary which is used to administer etcd clusters. This release now drives the `etcdctl` CLI by having it talk to peers one-by-one rather than as a list since `etcdctl` swallows errors when given a full list of peers. This simply improves debuggability. [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/117746013)\n- Other non-functional changes.\n"
