  "Content": "Key changes include configurable subnet ranges and masks, self service policy configuration and enhancements for reducing policy enforce time. \n\nWe do not recommend using netman-release in production yet, but give it a try and give us your feedback in the [#container-networking](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/container-networking/details/) channel on cloudfoundry.slack.com. Take a look at [known issues](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/netman-release/blob/develop/docs/known-issues.md) for current limitations and known issues.\n\nVerified with the following:\n- [CF deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/2c07794c35775bc0b7d630792b1c63b9acc65ce9/cf-deployment.yml#L1441)\n\n## Significant Changes\n\n### Deployment Changes\n- [The subnet and mask for the overlay network is configurable](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/136514947)\n- [As an operator I would like to support more than 254 cells  with **legacy networking features**](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/136965707)\n\n### Space Developer self-service policy configuration\n- [Space developers with network.write scope can create policies using the API for apps in spaces they own](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/131741793)\n- [Space developers with network.write scope can delete policies for apps in spaces they own](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/136754361)\n\n### UX changes\n- [Remove old delete API endpoint](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/135821159)\n\n### Performance and Scalability\n- [As an operator I don't expect iptables to be rewritten continuously when there are no policy changes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/136968547)\n\n### Miscellaneous Changes\n- [The eureka demo example uses the CF_INSTANCE_INTERNAL_IP environment variable](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/136624957)\n- [Compare ingress networking  performance with and without netman](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/136802589)\n"
