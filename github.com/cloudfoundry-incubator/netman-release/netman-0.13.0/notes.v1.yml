  "Content": "Key changes include support for self-service space developer configuration. A user can now request a `network.write` scope to configure policies for spaces where they have Space Developer privileges.  \nWe do not recommend using netman-release in production yet, but give it a try and give us your feedback in the [#container-networking](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/container-networking/details/) channel on cloudfoundry.slack.com. Take a look at [known issues](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/netman-release/blob/develop/docs/known-issues.md) for current limitations and known issues.\n\nVerified with the following:\n- [CF deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/95df5583cb37bfd3bd6d83b73b9c46d7111dfa2f/cf-deployment.yml#L1470)\n\n## Significant Changes\n\n### Self-service for space developers\n- [Space developers with network.write scope can list policies for apps in spaces they own](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/136836027)\n\n### Scalability and performance\n- [scalability tests should pass with 200 apps, 10 instances and 3 policies each](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/132687215)\n- [IP tables for policies should not be re-written when policies have not changed](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/137319137)\n"
