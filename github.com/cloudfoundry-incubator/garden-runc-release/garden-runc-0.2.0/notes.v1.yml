  "Content": "- Rename `destroy_containers_on_startup` property to `destroy_containers_on_start`, to match Garden-Linux-Release\n- `NetOut` rules now work correctly across server restarts\n- Remove `tag` property, which was only present for testing and was not used\n- Set `$TMPDIR` to a sensible path in `/var/vcap/data`, rather than using the tiny `/tmp` provided by BOSH\n- Add the `network_pool` property\n\nYou can find a guide to transitioning from Garden-Linux to Garden-RunC [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-docs/blob/master/transition-guide.md).\n"
