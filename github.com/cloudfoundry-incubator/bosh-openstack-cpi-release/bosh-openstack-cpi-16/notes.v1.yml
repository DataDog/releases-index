  "Content": "- [Renamed job `cpi` to `openstack_cpi`](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/105868858)\n  - **Note:** This breaks current bosh-init deployment manifests! Be sure to change `director.cpi_job`, `cloud_provider.template`, and `templates` properties to specify `openstack_cpi`.\n- [User can specify security groups on `resource_pool`](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/104956254)\n  - You can still use existing manifests which specify security_groups on the network. [See docs](https://bosh.io/docs/openstack-cpi.html#resource-pools).\n  - Note: After implementing this feature we have removed configure_networks CPI implementation which means that changing floating IP for a VM will actually recreate that VM\n"
