  "Content": "- [Human-readable VM names](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/epic/show/2291339) - \n  The CPI can set more meaningful names for VMs now! Instead of UUIDs such as `vm-4971ee11-f956-406f-9220-8e1ee1a1873c` you get names such as `runner_z1/0`\n  - set [`openstack.human_readable_vm_names: true`](http://bosh.io/jobs/openstack_cpi?source=github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-openstack-cpi-release\u0026version=23#p=openstack.human_readable_vm_names)\n  - configure your registry with the [`registry.endpoint`](http://bosh.io/docs/openstack-registry.html) property to include basic auth credentials\n  - Existing VMs will not be touched, continue to work, and still have their UUID-based name\n- [Custom RootCA support for OpenStack Endpoints](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/epic/show/2291377) - If you previously set [`openstack.connection_options.ssl_validate_peer: false`](http://bosh.io/jobs/openstack_cpi?source=github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-openstack-cpi-release\u0026version=23#p=openstack.connection_options), you can now provide your custom RootCA certificate instead!\n  - Set [`openstack.connection_options.ca_cert`](http://bosh.io/jobs/openstack_cpi?source=github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-openstack-cpi-release\u0026version=23#p=openstack.connection_options) to the necessary certificate(s)\n  - configure your registry with the [`registry.endpoint`](http://bosh.io/docs/openstack-registry.html) property to include basic auth credentials\n"
