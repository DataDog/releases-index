  "Content": "* Verified with [grootfs-release v0.17.1](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/grootfs-release/releases/tag/v0.17.1)\r\n\r\n# Big Changes\r\n\r\n - Support for Authenticated (User/Pass) Docker Repositories in native `garden-shed` rootfs fetcher! Woop!\r\n\r\n# Little Changes and Fixes\r\n\r\n - RunC output is now streamed to the main garden log rather than collected after execution has finished. This enables better diagnostics for cases where runc hangs or deadlocks\r\n - Fixed a regressed that made `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf` not writable by root in the container\r\n - `max_containers` property is now enforced rather than just being reported in `client.Capacity()`\r\n - Changed `image_plugin` api to allow the plugin to return JSON in order to better support rootless containers using overlayfs (the image plugin API is still experimental and subject to change)"
