  "Content": "- Verified with [grootfs-release v0.11.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/grootfs-release/releases/tag/v0.11.0)\n\nHi garden fans! Today we have a bumper release with lots of nice little fixes and improvements:\n\n**API Changes and Deprecations:**\n- **Docker Auth Support:** The `client.Create` call now supports an `Image.URI` field which deprecates the existing `RootfsPath` field. It acts in exactly the same way as the existing field, however it is now possible to specify `Image.Username` and `Image.Password` which will be passed to the `image_plugin` if configured. This allows an image_plugin (such as [grootfs](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/grootfs)) to support authenticated Docker images.\n- **Create-Time NetIn/Out:** `NetIn` and `NetOut` are now able to be specified on the `client.Create` call, and we recommend all clients switch to this as the dynamic methods are now deprecated. If specified, they are passed to the `network_plugin` on create, which allows better integration with `CNI` up/down hooks. The existing methods will continue to be supported in the built-in `kawasaki` networker until the next major version bump.\n- **Image Plugin API:** Experimental `image_plugin` API continues to evolve, now does not needlessly swap uid before running the plugin in unprivileged mode (this is up to the plugin to do if it wishes).\n- **Grace Time:** `grace_time` now defaults to `0` (i.e. infinity). Most clients were explicitly overriding our default here anyway, and without this default it is impossible to later ask for a container not to have a grace time (since 0 in `client.Create` means \"use the default\"). **Clients must now explicitly set the `grace_time` bosh property if they wish containers to have a grace time by default**.\n\n**General Improvements**\n- RunC was bumped to the latest version\n- `Inspector-garden` is no longer needed! You can now interact with containers without any extra steps. (Yay!)\n- Fixed handling of the bosh release shutdown script to avoid a case where a non-zero exit was returned to bosh even though the server had been killed\n- The bosh release now increases pid limits to avoid running out of pids in large deployments (to avoid pid exhaustion from containers we recommend configuring `ContainerSpec.Pids.Max` in the `client.Create` call).\n- It is possible to opt-out of apparmor (for environments which cannot support it), by specifying an empty string for the `apparmor_profile` property. It is also possible to request a different apparmor profile than the garden-default be used, so long as this is installed on the host (for example as a bosh pre-start job in an add-on).\n- iptables rules now add a descriptive comment containing the container guid for easier debuggability\n- Work continues on the experimental rootless mode, there is now a separate `setup` command which can be run as root, allowing the main guardian server to start up without needing root.\n"
