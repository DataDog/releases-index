  "Content": "This release implements enough of a Garden backend that it can be used to deploy Cloud Foundry and run CATS. It is not yet suitable for deployment in production.\r\n\r\nManifests that work with [Garden-Linux-Release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux-release) should continue to work for Guardian-Release, although some properties will be superfluous.\r\n\r\nCompared to [Garden-Linux-Release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux-release), **at least** the following features are missing:\r\n\r\n- Graph cleanup cannot be enabled\r\n- CPU limits are not enforced\r\n- Metrics/BulkMetrics calls return incomplete info\r\n- Container limits can be set, but not retrieved (e.g. `container.CurrentMemory()` returns nothing useful)"
