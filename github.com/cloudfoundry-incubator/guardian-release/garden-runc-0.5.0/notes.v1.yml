  "Content": "Much good stuff:\n- AppArmor! Unprivileged containers are now secured with a default apparmor profile. This is based on the default docker apparmor profile for maximum compatibility\n- The `shared_mounts` bosh property is gone, we now do the right thing for anything in `/var/vcap/data`\n- We now use the new OCI \"create/start\" split to run network plugins, allowing much more flexibility in how this works and cleaning up the code a lot\n- Iodaemon is gone, we now use a binary called 'dadoo' to do a roughly similar job\n- Reattaching after restart should now be more bulletproof, for example getting the exit code should work\n- Code now imported via `code.cloudfoundry.org` domain\n"
