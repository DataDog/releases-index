  "Content": "- fix to installed libfuse package so that we don't fail when mounting, then unmounting, then remounting on the same mount point (common during bosh upgrades against running environments.)\r\n- better recovery from mount failures so that we don't leave partially mounted directories that block bosh pre-start.\r\n- minor logging fixes in unmount error conditions\r\n- add optional `export_cidr` parameter to nfstestserver job to allow nfstestserver to be used in non `10.x` subnets."
