It is not recommended to set it any higher than this if you intend to use disk limits.\n- Disk limits can now be set using the `DiskLimitScopeTotal` scope. All scopes are now functional.\n- Disk usage now reports total container disk usage in addition to container exclusive disk usage for containers created with disk limits.\n- For NetIn rules where a host side port is not specified, ports are now allocated from the host port pool with FIFO semantics. This port side host usage data is persisted across garden-linux server process restarts, but not across recreation of the VM.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nThere's another new property, `state_dir_path`, which was added by mistake. Please don't use this, as we're going to remove it in the next release.\n"
