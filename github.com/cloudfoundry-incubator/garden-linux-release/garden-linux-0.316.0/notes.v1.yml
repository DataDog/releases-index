  "Content": "_Should have been 0.309.0, but we had a bug in our pipeline which bumped the version crazy high ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯_\n\nmatching garden sha: [295b3b7d64d3a92ec6aba1ebf6a2ad54053e52b7](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden/commit/295b3b7d64d3a92ec6aba1ebf6a2ad54053e52b7)\n- Added `btrfs_force_sync` property, which defaults to `true`. Set this to `false` to avoid calling `sync` when asking the backend for metrics or container info. You'll get less accurate disk usage info, but performance may be better.\n- Made some small improvements to container creation time by not copying as many binaries around (more to come here)\n- Improved logging of subnet allocation and deallocation\n- Fixed a small bug with setting the btrfs store size\n"
