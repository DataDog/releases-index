  "Content": "**Changes**:\n\nFixes a bug in `confab`, the wrapper program for orchestrating the start of the `consul` binary.  The previous behaviour was that if `confab` is started a second time, it will kill the previously running `consul` process, leaving nothing running.  The new correct behaviour is for `confab` to fail if `consul` is already running, but not kill `consul`.\n"
