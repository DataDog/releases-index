  "Content": "**Changes**:\n- In order to \"BOSH-ify\" Consul, some fairly complex logic is required to automatically ensure robustness of the cluster in the face of both normal BOSH lifecycle operations (e.g. rolling updates) and unplanned \"disasters\" such as hardware failure leading to temporary quorum loss.  `consul-release` manages the Consul process with a wrapper program called `confab`.  `confab` encapsulates the complex logic mentioned above.  This release introduces a significant change to `confab` which should allow a Consul server cluster to recover better from a temporary quorum loss. [details](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/128618241)\n- This release has been marked as a pre-release since (a) recently added features in v111 and v112 should not be used and are reverted in a later release, and (b) the changes mentioned above were found to have an issue.\n- Other non-functional changes.\n"
