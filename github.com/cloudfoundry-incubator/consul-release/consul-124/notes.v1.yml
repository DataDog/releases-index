  "Content": "**This is marked as a pre-release as there is an unresolved [issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/consul-release/issues/48) with a change introduced in this [v122](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/consul-release/releases/tag/v122)**\n\n**Changes**:\n- Replaced `consul.dns_timeout_in_seconds` property in `consul_agent` job with `consul.agent.dns_config.recursor_timeout`, and now passes this value on to the Consul binary. This solves a known issue with how Consul's recursing handles slow DNS queries. [details](https://pivotaltracker.com/story/show/129671425)\n"
