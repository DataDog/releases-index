  "Content": "**Changes**:\n- This release fixes an issue with a previous version around only modifying `/etc/resolv.conf` when dnsmasq is enabled.  However, a future release removes dnsmasq altogether, and you are recommended to skip this release.  You will run into issues if you deploy a version that uses dnsmasq and then try to upgrade to a later release that removes it.\n- This release improves the startup logic that orchestrates the Consul binary to maintain its current SLA during regular BOSH lifecycle operations, but now additional should work better recovering from quorum loss.\n- Properties `consul.agent_key` and `consul.agent_cert` are now required for `consul_agent` job running with `mode: server`.\n"
