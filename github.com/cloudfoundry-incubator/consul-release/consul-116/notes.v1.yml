  "Content": "**Changes**:\n- This release introduces significant changes to the way `consul_agent` works, introducing `dnsmasq` for DNS recursion and having it delegate to Consul only for queries matching the Consul domain.  These changes are currently work-in-progress and have some minor issues which will be ironed out in the next few releases.\n- Removes the recently added `consul.agent.ports.dns` and `consul.rewrite_resolv` properties from the `consul_agent` job and introduces `consul.include_dnsmasq`, `consul.dnsmasq.dns_timeout_in_seconds`, and `consul.dnsmasq.nameservers` properties with defaults of `true`, `5`, and `[cf.internal/127.0.0.1#8600]` respectively.\n"
