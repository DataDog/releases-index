  "Content": "New Features:\r\n- Support to set idle timeout in minutes for dynamic public IPs by configuring `pip_idle_timeout_in_minutes` in global Azure properties.\r\n  - The default idle timeout of Azure public IPs is 4 minutes. The available value is [4, 30]. It must be integer.\r\n  - If the interval that your applications send `keep-alive` is longer than the idle timeout, the TCP connections from/to the public IPs will be closed by Azure. So you need to increase the idle timeout of public IPs or decrease the interval in your applications.\r\n  - If you set a too big value as the idle timeout, all ports associated with public IPs may be exhausted if your applications do not close TCP connections properly.\r\n- Keep failed VM if the VM fails in provisioning.\r\n  - Sometimes, the user needs to keep the VM for troubleshooting when the VM provisioning fails due to some platform or stemcell issues.\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n- Fix that some functions eat exceptions.\r\n\r\nDocs:\r\n- Add a [doc](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-azure-cpi-release/blob/master/docs/advanced/backup-and-restore-cloud-foundry/README.md) about how to backup and restore Cloud Foundry"
