  "Content": "Breaking Changes:\n- Change the Azure CPI job name from `cpi` to `azure_cpi`. You should update your `bosh.yml`.\n  From\n  \n  ```\n  jobs:\n  - name: bosh\n    templates:\n    - {name: cpi, release: bosh-azure-cpi}\n  \n    properties:\n      director:\n        cpi_job: cpi\n  \n  cloud_provider:\n    template: {name: cpi, release: bosh-azure-cpi}\n  ```\n  \n  to\n  \n  ```\n  jobs:\n  - name: bosh\n    templates:\n    - {name: azure_cpi, release: bosh-azure-cpi}\n  \n    properties:\n      director:\n        cpi_job: azure_cpi\n  \n  cloud_provider:\n    template: {name: azure_cpi, release: bosh-azure-cpi}\n  ```\n\nNew Features:\n- Allow to specify OS disk size by setting `root_disk.size` in cloud_properties of resource_pools.\n  - Default OS disk size depends on the size of VHD in the stemcell. It is 3 GiB for now.\n  - The size must be in the range [3 \\* 1024, 1023 \\* 1024]. Please always use `N * 1024` as the size because Azure always uses GiB but not MiB.\n- Allow to use OS disk to store ephemeral data by setting `ephemeral_disk.use_root_disk` to true in cloud_properties of resource_pools.\n  - Compatible Stemcell Versions: v3262.7 or later\n  - The OS disk will be atuomatically resized to `30 * 1024` MiB if you do not set `root_disk.size`.\n  - No data disk will be created as the ephemeral disk.\n- Allow to use `env.bosh.group_name` as the name of avaliability set.\n  - You still can use `availability_set` in cloud_properties of resource_pools as the name of avaliability set.\n  - If `availability_set` is not specified, Azure CPI will search `env.bosh.group_name` as the name of availability set. If neither `availability_set` nor `env.bosh.group_name` exists, VMs in this resource_pool won't be in any availability set.\n- Support to pick an available storage account under the default resource group to create VMs by a pattern automatically.\n  - You can use a pattern `*keyword*` as `storage_account_name` in cloud_properties of resource_pools.\n  - The pattern must start with `*` and end with `*`.\n  - The keyword must only contain numbers and lower-case letters because of the naming rule of storage account name.\n  - The rule to select an available storage account is to check the number of disks under the container `bosh` does not exceed the limitation.\n  - The default number of disks limitation is 30 but you can specify it in `storage_account_max_disk_number`.\n  - `storage_account_max_disk_number` is the number of disks limitation in a storage account.\n    1. Every storage account has a limitation to host disks. You may hit the performance issue if you create too many disks in one storage account.\n    2. The maximum number of disks of a standard storage account is 40 because the maximum IOPS of a standard storage account is 20,000 and the maximum IOPS of a standard disk is 500.\n    3. If you are using premium storage account, Azure maps the disk size (rounded up) to the nearest Premium Storage Disk option (P10, P20 and P30). For example, a disk of size 100 GiB is classified as a P10 option.\n       - The maximum number of disks of a premium storage account is 280 if you are using P10 (128 GiB) as your disk type.\n       - The maximum number of disks of a premium storage account is 70 if you are using P20 (512 GiB) as your disk type.\n       - The maximum number of disks of a premium storage account is 35 if you are using P30 (1024 GiB) as your disk type.\n    4. `storage_account_max_disk_number` should be less than the maximum number. Suggest you to use (MAX - 10) as the value because CPI always creates VMs in parallel.\n    5. Please see more information about [azure-subscription-service-limits](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/azure-subscription-service-limits/).\n\nImprovements:\n- Log x-ms-request-id, x-ms-correlation-request-id and x-ms-routing-request-id in xRP responses and get_token response for trouble shooting.\n- Use `2016-06-01` as RP API version for AzureChinaCloud.\n- Update Azure API version for resource provider to `2016-06-01` and others to `2015-06-15`.\n- Using `azure-storage` instead of `azure-sdk-for-ruby` to access Azure storage.\n- Check whether a property is nil but not only exist if it is required.\n- Pick default ephemeral disk size based on instance type if `ephemeral_disk.size` in cloud_properties of resource_pools is not set.\n  - If the Azure temporary disk size for the instance type is less than `30*1024` MiB, the default size is `30*1024` MiB because the space may not be enough.\n  - If the Azure temporary disk size for the instance type is larger than `1023*1024` MiB, the default size is `1023*1024` MiB because max data disk size is `1023*1024` MiB on Azure.\n  - Otherwise, the Azure temporary disk size will be used as the default size. See more information about [Azure temporary disk size](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-sizes/).\n- CPI does not delete availability sets because it is difficult to know whether an availability set will be used or not.\n- Allow to specify `storage_account_type` and `storage_account_location` in cloud_properties of resource_pools to use a non-exist storage account. CPI will create the storage account automatically.\n  - `storage_account_type` is required if the storage account does not exist. It can be either `Standard_LRS`, `Standard_ZRS`, `Standard_GRS`, `Standard_RAGRS` or `Premium_LRS`. You can click [**HERE**](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/) to learn more about the type of Azure storage account.\n  - `storage_account_location` is needed if the storage account does not exist. If it is not set, the location of the default resource group will be used. You can use azure cli command `azure location list` to list all locations. For more information, see [List all of the available geo-locations](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/).\n- Append error details in exceptions so that users can see the error details in the console when executing bosh-init/bosh command.\n\nFixes:\n- Handle the race when multiple processes are creating a same storage account in parallel. Please see more details about the issue #176.\n- CPI packaging should not fail on OS X with Homebrew-installed OpenSSL. Please see more details about the issue #184.\n- RetryableError often happens when deleting a deployment. Please see more details about the issue #179.\n- CPI should make sure to log ruby stacktrace to stderr when exception occurs. Please see more details about the issue #177.\n\nDev:\n- Update CI pipeline after upgrading concourse to `v1.6.0`.\n- Update docker image for CI pipeline.\n  - Upgrade ruby version to `v2.2.4`\n  - Use Ubuntu 15.04\n  - Install nodejs 4.x and npm\n  - Install Azure CLI 0.10.1\n"
