  "Content": "New Features:\n- Support multiple NICs. \n  - Current CentOS stemcells do not work. Need to wait new stemcells with the code change in this PR #[1457](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh/pull/1457).\n  - You can reference this doc [Deploy multiple network interfaces (NICs) for a VM in Azure Cloud Foundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-azure-cpi-release/tree/master/docs/advanced/deploy-multiple-network-interfaces).\n- Create containers in new storage accounts (NOT default storage account) if they do not exist #195\n  - DO NOT check/create containers in the default storage account for performance\n  - Check/create containers in the new storage account only before one stemcell needs to be copied from the default storage account\n- Use env.bosh.group instead of env.bosh.group_name #205\n  - This is a new request. You can reference the feature request #171\n\nImprovements:\n- Set `x-ms-client-request-id` for all xRP requests for troubleshooting\n  - CPI generates a GUID as the value of `x-ms-client-request-id` in every xRP request header\n  - CPI logs this id before sending the request to Azure resource provider\n  - We can use this id to check Azure logs when CPI cannot get Azure response\n\nFixes:\n- Update azure-storage-ruby to 0.11.0.preview. #208\n  - This also fixes the issue that azure-storage-ruby does not retry automatically when OpenTimeout\n- Auto retry when ReadTimeout and ECONNRESET #203\n  - CPI will retry automatically when ReadTimeout or ECONNRESET\n"
