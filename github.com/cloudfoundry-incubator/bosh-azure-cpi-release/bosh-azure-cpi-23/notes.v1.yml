  "Content": "New Features:\r\n- Support Windows heavy and light stemcells for both managed disks and unmanaged disks.\r\n  - Do not need to set `windows.username` and `windows.password` in `bosh.yml`. `username` and `password` are required when creating Windows VMs but BOSH never use it, so CPI automatically generates 15 secure random characters as `username` and 72 secure random characters as `password`.\r\n  - Disable Windows AutoUpdate. Users always use new stemcells for update.\r\n- Support AzureStack TP3.\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n- Fix #259: Use Json format to store light stemcell information.\r\n- Redact credentials in logs\r\n  - Credentials only can be logged when `debug_mode` is set to true.\r\n"
