  "Content": "Improvements:\n- BOSH group name is often too long to generate an availability set name automatically. #209\n  - On Azure the length of the availability set name must be between 1 and 80 characters. `env.bosh.group` which is generated by BOSH director may be too long. CPI will truncate the name to the following format `az-MD5-[LAST-40-CHARACTERS-OF-GROUP]` if the length of `env.bosh.group` is greater than 80.\n"
