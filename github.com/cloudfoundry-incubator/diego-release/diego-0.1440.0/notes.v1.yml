  "Content": "## Changes from v0.1439.0 to v0.1440.0\n- Depends on [garden-linux-release v0.326.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux-release/releases/tag/v0.326.0).\n- Depends on [etcd-release 18](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/18).\n\n### Important changes\n\nThe recommended version of garden-linux-release, v0.326.0, has changed its backing layer system to use aufs instead of btrfs. Please see the notes for this Garden-Linux final release for more details.\n\nIf you are upgrading from garden-linux-release v0.316.0 or earlier, we recommend you recreate your Diego Cells during the upgrade to v0.326.0 and later, to avoid issues with residual containers on the btrfs volume that garden-linux will be unable to delete. You can do this intentionally with the `--recreate` flag on `bosh deploy`, or incidentally by deploying a new stemcell at the same time. If you've been waiting to upgrade your stemcell, now's a great time!\n\nAlso, if you are using the `generate-deployment-manifest` script to produce your Diego deployment manifest, please be aware that it has incorporated a few changes to its arguments:\n- The optional 'director-uuid' stub argument is now removed, as the BOSH director UUID will be taken from the CF manifest.\n- There is a new required argument that expects a stub optionally specifying the versions of the Diego, Garden-Linux, and ETCD releases to deploy. If any of these versions are missing, they will default to 'latest'.\n\n### Other significant changes\n- [Errors about invalid DesiredLRPs should not prevent the nsync-bulker from bumping the cf-apps domain](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/106517944)\n- [As a Diego developer, I would like documentation about which BBS API endpoints are public or private](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/103274360)\n- [If the rep gets an unrecoverable error from garden when starting up, it should exit immediately](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/103687290)\n- [Diego ssh proxy template should not require `ssh_proxy.diego_credentials` to be set if the diego authenticator is not enabled](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/104186064)\n- [environment variables from the default running group sometimes do not appear in the apps environment](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/106174386)\n- [Remove director_uuid argument from generate-deployment-manifest](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/105025196)\n- [diego manifest generation should use the cf release version specified in the cf-release manifest used as a stub rather than defaulting to latest](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/105514194)\n- [As a Diego operator, I should be able to specify versions of the diego, etcd, and garden-linux releases when generating a manifest](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/105614176)\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release #85: Enables other stub configurations to be merged in after the enable_ssâ€¦](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/105611266)\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/consuladapter #1: Add KillWithFire func](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/105761862)\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/candiedyaml #16: Fix panic for strings less than 3 chars](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/106188728)\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/executor #15: Fix race condition in run step test](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/106925176)\n- [Roll back garden-linux-release on CI to 0.316](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/107421130)\n- [enable aufs on ci](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/107088394)\n- [Enable aufs on CI](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/107422734)\n\n### BOSH property changes\n\nNone.\n"
