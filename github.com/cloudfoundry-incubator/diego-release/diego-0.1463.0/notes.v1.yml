  "Content": "## Changes from v0.1462.0 to v0.1463.0\n- Verified with [garden-linux-release v0.335.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux-release/releases/tag/v0.335.0).\n- Verified with [etcd-release v43](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/v43).\n\n### Significant changes\n\n**Note**: We decided to remove the consul-agent port properties that were added to the diego-release BOSH jobs in Diego v0.1462.0. The HTTP API port on the consul-agent job in consul-release cannot itself be configured, so the port properties would not be immediately useful, and if it is made configurable in the future it may make more sense for the entire address or URL to be configurable instead. We hope the removal of these properties has not inconvenienced anyone consuming the release.\n\n#### BBS Relational Datastore (Experimental)\n- [As a Diego developer, I can run BBS unit tests against MySQL on my local workstation](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113854821) (in flight)\n\n#### Routing\n- [When the rep is shutting down after finishing evacuation, it should remove its evacuating ActualLRPs](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/111845893)\n\n#### Volume Support (Experimental)\n- [CI runs VolMan integration tests using CephFS driver and Ceph cluster](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114241305)\n- [tasks can create and mount a volume](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114500731)\n- [LRPs can create and mount a volume](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114501353)\n- [volman can remove volumes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114704333)\n- [Auctioneer filters cells by volume driver](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116222453)\n- [executor and rep function correctly with volman disabled](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116247079)\n\n#### CC-Bridge Transfer\n- [CAPI Release - CC Bridge components](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113941499) (in flight)\n\n#### Manifest Generation\n- [Ensure all diego-release job defaults are in the job specs, instead of in ERB or spiff templates](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/108792530)\n\n#### Dependencies\n- [Upgrade Golang in diego-release to 1.6+](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112342453)\n\n#### Test Suites and Tooling\n- [Remove BBS measurements suite](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114695295)\n- [don't run ssh tests in persi CI](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116735339)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nNone.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n- Removed `diego.auctioneer.consul_agent_port`.\n- Removed `diego.bbs.consul_agent_port`.\n- Removed `diego.cc_uploader.consul_agent_port`.\n- Removed `diego.converger.consul_agent_port`.\n- Removed `diego.file_server.consul_agent_port`.\n- Removed `diego.nsync.consul_agent_port`.\n- Removed `diego.rep.consul_agent_port`.\n- Removed `diego.route_emitter.consul_agent_port`.\n- Removed `diego.ssh_proxy.consul_agent_port`.\n- Removed `diego.stager.consul_agent_port`.\n- Removed `diego.tps.consul_agent_port`.\n"
