  "Content": "## Changes from v0.1470.0 to v0.1471.0\n- Verified with [garden-linux-release v0.337.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux-release/releases/tag/v0.337.0).\n- Verified with [etcd-release v49](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/v49).\n- Verified with [cflinuxfs2-rootfs-release v1.5.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cflinuxfs2-rootfs-release/releases/tag/v1.5.0).\n\n### Significant changes\n\n**IMPORTANT**: This version of Diego fixes [CVE-2016-3091](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/message/LUIIJLIZ77253X34SQADKXROHVFXYGN4/), a vulnerability related to the Diego executor's parsing of log output at UTF-8 boundaries. We strongly recommend that all operators on Diego 0.1468.0 through 0.1470.0 upgrade to Diego 0.1471.0 or later. Diego 0.1472.0 is recommended for use with the recently released CF v237.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: This version of Diego removes the `-r` flag from its manifest-generation script entirely, causing the script to fail if provided. Operators using the manifest-generation script should remove that flag. We also realize that this removal is inconsistent with how other flags to that script have been deprecated, so it will be accepted again with a deprecation notice in the forthcoming Diego v0.1472.0 release. \n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Garden team has recently renamed 'guardian' to '[garden-runc](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-runc-release)', so the `-g` flag to the manifest-generation script now opts the operator into using the [garden-runc release](http://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-runc-release?all=1) instead of opting into using the guardian release. This change also requires users of the guardian release to upload the garden-runc release to their BOSH directors instead.\n\n#### BBS Relational Datastore (Experimental)\n- [BBS can be configured to communicate to the relational store over SSL](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113854841) (in flight)\n\n#### Routing\n- [Investigate route-emitter hanging forever in sync](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/119057201)\n- [route-emitter should use MinimumRegisterInterval to determine how frequently it emits routes to the RouteEmitter](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/118530621)\n\n#### Volume Support (Experimental)\n- [Volman can discover docker drivers in an ordered list of folders](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/118324851)\n\n#### Garden-RunC Integration\n- [Change Diego-release manifest-generation and CI environments to use garden-runc-release instead of guardian-release](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/117445671)\n\n#### Rootfs Release Extraction\n- [Remove `-r` flag from diego manifest generation script](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/117205719)\n\n#### Component Logging and Metrics\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-lager #2: Remove dead variables](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/118845229)\n\n#### Test Suites and Tooling\n- [Run volman tests by default](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/118197785)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nNone.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n- Added `diego.bbs.sql.ca_cert`: CA certificate to use when connecting to a relational store via TLS.\n- Added `diego.executor.volman.driver_paths`: Path string containing the directories volman will look in for voldriver specs.\n"
