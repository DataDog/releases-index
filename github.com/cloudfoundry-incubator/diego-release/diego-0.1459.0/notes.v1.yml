  "Content": "## Changes from v0.1458.0 to v0.1459.0\n- Depends on [garden-linux-release v0.334.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux-release/releases/tag/v0.334.0).\n- Depends on [etcd-release v37](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release/releases/tag/v37).\n\n### Significant changes\n\n**NOTE**: Although [Diego v0.1455.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release/releases/tag/v0.1455.0) re-introduced the feature that SSH sessions and commands in a CF app container have the same environment variables set as the app's main process, we have rolled that functionality back in Diego v0.1459.0. For buildpack-based apps, the mechanism by which this feature was implemented would execute the buildpack-installed `.profile.d` scripts twice. While those scripts often only set environment variables for the app process, in general they can have arbitrary effects, and may not be safe to call repeatedly and concurrently. The team is considering safer ways to share that environment, but for now we will leave it unimplemented.\n\nTo support SSH users who wish to have the same environment as their start commands, we have submitted documentation of the manual steps to set up that environment to the developer-guide [Cloud Foundry documentation repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/docs-dev-guide). Those changes will appear on the [\"Accessing Apps with SSH\" page](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-apps.html) shortly.\n\n#### Custom CAs\n- [cflinuxfs2 rootfs pre-start script should retry certificate installation](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115350743)\n\n#### SSH\n- [Roll back SSH environment setup changes (again)](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115355041)\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-ssh #21: add flags to ssh-proxy for specifying allowed cipher,mac,kex algorithms](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115145479)\n\n#### CF Tasks\n- [As a space developer, I expect the 'source' for task logging to be [App/TASK/TASK_NAME]](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/111472198)\n\n#### Component Logging and Metrics\n- [log cell id when cell is missing](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115449245)\n\n#### Documentation\n- [Document the Tasks API (public and internal) and Actions on the BBS](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112320939)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nNone.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n\nNone.\n"
