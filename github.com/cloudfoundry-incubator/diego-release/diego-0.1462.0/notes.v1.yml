Work is currently proceeding in the BBS codebase, but we expect it to be exposed through BOSH configuration and manifest-generation in the near future. Please note that this work is strictly experimental and hence is not yet supported for production deployments.\n\nThis version of the Diego BOSH release also uses Golang 1.6 throughout. If you are building Diego components locally, please upgrade your Golang runtime to 1.6.\n\nThe Diego and Persi teams have been working on experimental support for volume mounts in the executor and the BBS. Any additions to the Diego APIs to enable this work are completely experimental and may change at any time.\n\nThe Buildpacks and Diego teams have started work to extract the 'rootfses' job in the Diego BOSH release into its own independent release. For now, Diego manifests can be used unchanged. If you are using the manifest-generation scripts and templates in diego-release, you can opt-in to using the new release with the `-r` flag (don't forget to create and upload the rootfs release before deploying!). \n\nThe CAPI and Diego teams have also started work to transfer the CC-Bridge jobs (stager, cc-uploader, nsync, and tps) from Diego to the new CAPI release. This transfer requires no manifest changes at present. Since the manifest-generation scripts already rely on the presence of a CF release and deployment, we expect to be able to make this transition transparent, with the option to opt-in early via a flag on the manifest-generation script.\n\n#### BBS Relational Datastore (Experimental)\n- [As a Diego developer, I can run BBS unit tests against MySQL on my local workstation](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113854821) (in flight)\n\n#### Performance Tuning\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release #146: Add a switch to control writing to /proc/sys](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115904293)\n\n#### SSH\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release #144: add ssh-proxy properties for specifying allowed cipher,mac,kex algorithms](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115756635)\n\n#### Volume Support (Experimental)\n- [tasks can create and mount a volume](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114500731) (in flight)\n- [LRPs can create and mount a volume](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/114501353) (in flight)\n- [Volume Drivers have an HTTP transport using .json file](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115265379) (in flight)\n- [executor advertises available volume drivers](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116221771) (in flight)\n\n#### Rootfs Release Extraction\n- [Extract diego-release 'rootfses' job and related packages and blobs into a cflinuxfs2-rootfs-release](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115888335) (in flight)\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release #148: This is a work in progress to separate the rootfs bosh release](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116259617)\n\n#### CC-Bridge Transfer to CAPI\n- [CAPI Release - CC Bridge components](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/113941499) (in flight)\n- [fix app and task freshness bumping in nsync bulker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115797235)\n- [refactor processor](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115797413)\n\n#### Manifest Generation\n- [Ensure all diego-release job defaults are in the job specs, instead of in ERB or spiff templates](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/108792530) (in flight)\n- [Change order of jobs in job template lists to start consul first](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/110832814)\n\n#### Dependencies\n- [Upgrade Golang in diego-release to 1.6+](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/112342453) (in flight)\n- [Upgrade cflinuxfs2 rootfs in diego-release to ~~1.47.0+~~ 1.48.0+](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116171507)\n\n#### Documentation\n- [cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release #147: Feedback on AWS deployment instructions](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116088089)\n\n#### Licensing\n- [Update LICENSE and NOTICE files on diego repos](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116376479)\n\n### BOSH job changes\n\nNone.\n\n### BOSH property changes\n- Added `diego.auctioneer.consul_agent_port`: Port on which the Auctioneer connects to the HTTP API of the local consul agent.
