  "Content": "Improvements:\n- [User should see an error message if other VM has a requested IP address](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/104747500)\n  - Due to large number of users experiencing this problem either due to misconfigured IP ranges or run away VMs, CPI will now query vCenter for VMs with a requested IP address and raise an error if it finds any other VM using it. We have run a few benchmarks and found that such queries did not impact performance of the CPI.\n  - Example error message: `Cannot create new VM because of IP conflicts with other VMs on the same networks: [{:vm_name=\"vm-f3f6a5fb-0936-4aed-95d9-c079a44e4f64\", :network_name=\"salsa\", :ip=\"10.85.33.95\"}]`\n- [User should be able to switch back and forth from using vSphere resource pools](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/106999568)\n  - We started querying vCenter for all VMs to find a specific VM by name. We have run a few benchmarks and found that such queries did not impact performance of the CPI.\n"
