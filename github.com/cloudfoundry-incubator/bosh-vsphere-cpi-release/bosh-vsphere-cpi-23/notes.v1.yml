  "Content": "New Features:\n- Allow to specify `datastores` key for VMs to limit CPIs placement decision for root and ephemeral disks\n- Allow to specify `datastores` key for persistent disks to limit CPIs placement decision\n\nImprovements:\n- Increased number of file upload retries from 2 to 5 (typically used for env.iso management)\n- Improve readability of \"no valid placement\" errors\n- Tweaked persistent disk placement algorithm\n  \n  \u003e Placement algorithm performs a weighted random sort on the available_datastores to improve disk load balancing. The sort multiplies each datastore's free_space by a random float 0..1 then sorts in descending order. This means the largest datastores have the highest chance of being first, but adds a bit of randomization. After the sort, disks are placed into the first datastore that has enough space for that disk.\n\nDev:\n- Use `exec` to avoid sticky bash process around CPI command\n"
