  "Content": "- Use EBS disks for ephemeral disk (`/var/vcap/data`) instead of instance storage\n  - Very convenient when shutting down and starting up large number of machines directly in AWS\n  - Can opt-in to use instance storage via `ephemeral_disk.use_instance_storage=true`\n- Allow encryption of ephemeral disks via `ephemeral_disk.encrypted=true` property\n- Allow use of new volume types: `st1` and `sc1` for ephemeral and persistent disks\n- Allow mixing of security group names and IDs and be very explicit when exactly one security group cannot be found\n"
