  "Content": "In addition to the changes below, we're starting to switch to semantic versioning (i.e. [semver](http://semver.org/) conventions and `23.0.0` instead `22`). We're also starting to publish dev releases via CI from our `develop` branch if you prefer testing recent changes before we create final releases (see [readme](https://github.com/logsearch/logsearch-boshrelease/tree/v23.0.0#release-channels)).\n\nBreaking Changes:\n- ingestors no longer support SSLv3 (dropped upstream by logstash)\n\nUpgrades:\n- logstash 1.5.4 (from 1.5.2; #172)\n\nEnhancements:\n- new [curator job](https://github.com/logsearch/logsearch-boshrelease/blob/v23.0.0/jobs/curator/spec) to regularly remove indices older than a configurable period (#72, via #170)\n- new [`logstash_parser.inputs` property](https://github.com/logsearch/logsearch-boshrelease/blob/v23.0.0/jobs/parser/spec#L36-L46) to configure parsers with non-redis inputs (via #160)\n- avoid extracting `syslog_procid`, `syslog_msgid` when they are empty (#138, via #175)\n\nDevelopment:\n- spiff templates now use separate queue and parser resource pools (via #169)\n- updated Concourse pipelines for more reliable CI testing, ability to test pull requests, and release automation (via #174)\n\nKnown Issues:\n-  Parser job crashes on start when using rabbitmq (via #178).  Cause by [elastic/logstash/issues/3781](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/3781), can be resolved by sshing into the parser VMs and running:\n  \n  ```\n  chmod 644 vendor/bundle/jruby/1.9/gems/march_hare-2.11.0-java/lib/ext/rabbitmq-client.jar\n  ```\n"
