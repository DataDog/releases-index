  "Content": "This release makes several changes which may require you to update your deployment manifest:\n- upgraded elasticsearch to 1.4 (#91)\n- no longer pre-install the HQ, marvel, or jetty elasticsearch plugins; instead you should now use the\n  `elasticsearch.plugins` property documented in 4f3a3ff47b7ea6bb99431d3ba0d68ab37bf26cf9\n- elasticsearch configuration is now YAML-based instead of JSON to make the cluster more easily customizable; you can\n  now use the `elasticsearch.config_options` and `elasticsearch.logging_options` string properties to append\n  deployment-specific settings to the generated defaults\n- we dropped the logstash_forwarder and collectd jobs; use logsearch/shipper-boshrelease or your own solution if you\n  want log and metric forwarding\n\nAdditionally, the following changes of less impact were made:\n- a new rolling restart script in share/util to ease the cluster process\n- the `logstash_parser.outputs` property can be used to send parsed events to a location in addition to logsearch's\n  elasticsearch (#92 via @rkoster)\n- a new, beta kibana job for testing the development version of kibana4 (4.0.0-beta3)\n- the certificates and keys used in the examples/bosh-lite.yml manifest were rotated\n- we've changed/improved our approach to project documentation, now maintaining content in the docs/ directory and\n  published to http://www.logsearch.io\n\nUpload this release to your BOSH using\n\n```\nbosh upload release https://s3.amazonaws.com/logsearch-boshrelease/releases/logsearch-18.tgz\n```\n"
