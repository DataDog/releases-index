  "Content": "- Debugging and detecting misconfigured or failing resource checks has\n  been improved.\n  \n  Resources that are failing to check will now be shown as errored in\n  the pipeline view. When viewing the resource, the check status will be\n  shown on its page, and the last check error will be shown if the user\n  is authenticated.\n- Viewing an already completed build is now much less painful. Rather\n  than streaming the events in and drawing the page live, we now process\n  all events and _then_ render the build. This greatly improves the\n  responsiveness of the UI and cuts the overall rendering time by ~6x.\n- We have fixed a few sources of potential resource leaks in the ATC. If\n  you noticed your deployment getting slower over time before, you may\n  want to try upgrading. Symptoms include high CPU and high memory use.\n- Blackbox can now deliver metrics from the ATC to Datadog. To configure\n  this, colocate the Blackbox job on your web VMs (be sure to list it as\n  the first job template), and set the following property:\n  \n  ``` racket\n  blackbox:                  \n  expvar:                  \n    datadog:               \n      api_key: blahblahblah\n  ```\n  \n  Currently emitted metrics are mainly focused on identifying resource\n  leaks. If youâ€™re noticing your deployment get slower over time, having\n  metrics would greatly help in reporting the bug.\n"
