  "Content": "\u003e Run `fly` `sync` to upgrade Fly after deploying v0.41.0!\n- The containers used for checking for new versions of resources can now\n  be hijacked with `fly` `hijack` `-c` `resource-name`. This should help\n  with debugging failing checks; once in the container you can directly\n  run the check by running something like this:\n  \n  `echo '{\"source\":{...}}' | /opt/resource/check`\n  \n  Where the `source` reflects the configuration for the resource in your\n  pipeline.\n  \n  In future releases there will be better ways to detect and debug\n  failing checks; this is just a first step.\n- The Git resource will now start checking over from `HEAD` when the ref\n  it’s checking from becomes invalid, e.g. when a `git` `push` `-f`\n  happens.\n  \n  This will also fix any stuck resources in deployments affected by the\n  bug introduced by v0.39.0 (later fixed in v0.40.0).\n"
