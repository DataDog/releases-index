  "Content": "- Jobs can now be configured with `serial_groups`, which can be used to\n  ensure multiple jobs do not run their builds concurrently. See\n  [the docs](http://concourse.ci/configuring-jobs.html) for more information.\n- Jobs can now be paused. This prevents newly created builds from\n  running until the job is unpaused.\n  \n  To pause a job, go to its page, which is now accessible by clicking\n  the job name when viewing a build, and click the pause button next to\n  its name in the header.\n- The abort button now aborts asynchronously, and also works when\n  aborting one-off builds.\n- If multiple template variables are not bound when configuring via a\n  pipeline template, all of their names are printed in the error, rather\n  than just the last one.\n- Resource `source` and `params` can now contain arbitrarily nested\n  configuration.\n- We’ve upgraded D3, which now does smoother zooming when\n  double-clicking or double-tapping the pipeline view.\n- The ’started’ indicator in the legend now does its little dance once\n  again.\n"
