  "Content": "\u003e Run `fly` `sync` to upgrade Fly after deploying v0.37.0!\n- `fly` `configure` `-c` now presents the user with the changes that the\n  new configuration applies, and asks for the user to confirm.\n  Committing the configurion is done atomically, meaning confirmation\n  always applies what you expect. It will reject it if what you’ve\n  compared against has since changed, i.e. another person has run\n  `fly` `configure`.\n- Concourse is now durable to the worker’s Garden servers going down (or\n  not being up) in the midst of builds running. This fixes `EOF` and\n  connection errors causing builds to error.\n- `fly` `configure` `-c` is now more helpful when it fails (it actually,\n  you know, prints the problem out, rather than silently failing).\n- The S3 resource now includes `url` metadata when fetched as an input.\n"
