It’s a doozy.\n- One-off builds can now be viewed in the web UI!\n  \n  There is an icon at the top right (in the nav bar) that will take you\n  to a page listing all builds that have ever run, including one-off\n  builds, with the most recent up top.\n- Resources can now be _paused_, meaning no new versions will be\n  collected or used in jobs until it is unpaused. This is useful to cut\n  off broken upstream dependencies.\n- Pipeline configurations can now be parameterized via\n  `fly` `configure`. This allows pipeline configurations to be reused,\n  or published with the credentials extracted into a separate (private)\n  file.\n- The Time resource can now be configured to trigger once, or on an\n  interval, within a time period. This can be used to e.g. run a build\n  that cleans up development environments every night, while no one’s at\n  work.\n- The super verbose and ugly perl warnings while cloning git\n  repositories has been fixed!\n- Some pipeline UI quirks have been fixed. Right-clicking no longer\n  triggers dragging around, and the zooming has been bounded (no more\n  losing your pipeline!).\n"
