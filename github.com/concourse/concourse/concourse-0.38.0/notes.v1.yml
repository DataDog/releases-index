This should catch common user errors (e.g. forgetting to nest\n  resource config under `source`) and backwards-incompatible changes\n  more safely (e.g. renaming `trigger` to something else).\n- You can now use the GitHub release resource without an access token\n  for everything except publishing a resource.\n- The GitHub Release resource now _actually_ supports being used as an\n  input. We had previously forgotten to actually wire in the command.\n  Woops.\n"
