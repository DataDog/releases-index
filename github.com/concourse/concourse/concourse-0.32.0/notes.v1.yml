  "Content": "- The faux ’back’ button on the build view page has been replaced with\n  the navigation bar from the main page.\n- The ATC’s logging level can be reconfigured via the API. Getting and\n  setting it is done via `GET` and `PUT` to `/api/v1/log-level`. Valid\n  values are `debug`, `info`, `error`, and `fatal`.\n  \n  Additional logging has been added at the `debug` level, now that it\n  can be kept quiet by default.\n- Fixed a bug that could cause pending builds of serial jobs to never\n  run. Upgrading prevents this and will fix any stuck jobs.\n- The main page is now durable to network errors, and will continue to\n  update.\n- Pending builds can now be aborted again.\n"
