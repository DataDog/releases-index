  "Content": "- Added a GitHub Releases resource. It can pull down and push up\n  multiple blobs, and tracks releases via their version. For more\n  details, see its\n  [README](https://github.com/concourse/github-release-resource/blob/efbfb916836366d729d8172f4f4eadaae34bac45/README.md).\n- The navigation bar is now present on every page.\n- Upgraded to Consul v0.5. This should fix cases where the workers would\n  lose contact with the ATC and never rejoin.\n- Fixed a panic in the ATC that would happen every time a job with no\n  build configuration finished.\n- Added missing merge strategy binaries to the Git resource; this allows\n  the `rebase` option to work in more cases.\n"
