  "Content": "There was a little delay in cutting this release as the ~~laptop~~ high\nperformance build cluster we use to build the Packer boxes was\ndecomissioned as we switched over to new hardware.\n- Workers can now advertise the platform that they support as well as\n  additional tags that can influence the placement of builds.\n  \n  Today’s build configs will have to start specifying an explicit\n  `platform`. See [missing] for more information. The main takeaway is\n  that you’ll need to add `platform:` `linux` to all of your\n  `build.yml`s.\n  \n  For more information on configuring additional workers, see [missing].\n- The scheduler semantics have been simplified which has the main effect\n  of making sure that disabled resources are not used in manually\n  triggered builds.\n- You can now download a compatible `fly` from ATC. Look for the links\n  in the bottom right of the main page. The new `fly` `sync` command can\n  be used to synchronise the version of `fly` with the targetted ATC.\n- The UI has been spruced up with some little icons. Let us know what\n  you think.\n- We’ve upgraded Go to version 1.4.2 inside the release. You shouldn’t\n  notice any difference with Concourse but this should give you a warm\n  fuzzy feeling inside.\n"
