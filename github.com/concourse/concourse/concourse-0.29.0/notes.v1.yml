This is useful if there is a\n  broken or pulled input resource version that you want to ignore in\n  automatically triggered builds.\n- The subtle pulsing animation that represented a running build has been\n  replaced by a more obvious effect.\n- If hijack-ing running builds isn’t your thing you can now run\n  `fly` `intercept` to achieve the same thing.\n- The S3 resource output metadata now includes the URL of the published\n  file. This only applies to public buckets.\n"
