  "Content": "*Please review these changes carefully - many properties and defaults have changed which may impact connectivity. While breaking changes are generally avoided, the goals of this release necessitated some significant changes. Those goals were: utilize modern BOSH features, encourage secure defaults, avoid duplicating features, and simplify configuration requirements.*\r\n\r\nBreaking Changes\r\n\r\n * properties are no longer prefixed with `openvpn` namespace\r\n * the `openvpn` job will no longer act as a client (see the new `openvpn-client` job)\r\n * the `openvpn` job improves security defaults (either explicitly use older values, or upgrade clients as necessary)\r\n    * `cipher` is now `AES-256-CBC` (this must be in sync with clients; previous default `BF-CBC`)\r\n    * `tls_version_min` is now `1.2` (requires clients 2.3.3+; previous default `1.0`)\r\n * custom iptables rules are no longer managed (use the `iptables` job of [networking](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/networking-release) release instead)\r\n * server and client certificates are now configured with the `tls_server` and `tls_client` properties, respectively (previously via `ca_crt`, `certificate`, and `private_key` properties)\r\n * certificate revocation lists for `openvpn` are now configured with the `tls_crl` property (previously via `crl_pem` property)\r\n\r\nNew Features\r\n\r\n * UDP is now supported (see `protocol` property of `openvpn`)\r\n * the openvpn `compress` option is now supported (see `compress` property of `openvpn`)\r\n * the openvpn `tls-crypt` option is now supported (see `tls_crypt` property of `openvpn`)\r\n * new `extra_configs` property of `openvpn` and `openvpn-client` (similar to `extra_config`, but accepts an array of openvpn directives)\r\n * new `device` property is now supported for explicit virtual network device usage\r\n * certificate-related properties can now be dynamically generated\r\n\r\nDevelopment \u0026 Tooling\r\n\r\n * git version tags now refer to the commit a release was created from (previously the commit which finalized the release was used)\r\n"
